<h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>
	It is assumed that Microsoft Visual Studio Professional (at least the Microsoft Visual C++ component) is installed. Although Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 should be sufficient, this how-to assumes that Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 is used. Furthermore, one should be familiar with the basics of Visual Studio, i.e., how to create a new project, how to edit source code, how to compile and build an application.
</p><p>
	Note for KU Leuven and UHasselt users: Microsoft Visual Studio is covered by the campus license for Microsoft products of both KU Leuven and Hasselt University. Hence staff and students can <a href=\"https://www.dreamspark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">download</a> and use the software.
</p><p>
	Also note that although Microsoft offers a free evaluation version of its development tools, i.e., Visual Studio Express, this version does not support parallel programming.
</p><h2>
OpenMP</h2><p>
	Microsoft Visual C++ offers support for developing openMP C/C++ programs out of the box. However, as of this writing, support is still limited to the ancient OpenMP 2.0 standard. The project type best suited is a Windows Console Application. It is best to switch 'Precompiled headers' off.
</p><p>
	Once the project is created, simply write the code, and enable the openMP compiler option in the project's properties as shown below.
</p><p>

</p><p>
	Compiling, building and running your program can now be done in the familiar way.
</p><h2>
MPI</h2><p>
	In order to develop C/C++ programs that use MPI, a few extra things have to be installed, so this will be covered first.
</p><h3>
Installation</h3><ol class=\"list--ordered\">
	<li>
	The MPI libraries and infrastructure is part of Microsoft's <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc853440(v=vs.85).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">HPC Pack SDK</a>. Download the either the 32- or 64-bit version, whichever is appropriate for your desktop system (most probably the 32-bit version, denoted by 'x86'). Installing is merely a matter of double-clicking the downloaded installer.</li>
	<li>
	Although not strictly required, it is strongly recommended to install the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClusterDebuggerLauncherCoreTeam.MPIProjectTemplate\" target=\"_blank\">MPI Project Template</a> as well. Again, one simply downloads and double-clicks the installer.</li>
</ol><h3>
Development</h3><p>
	To develop an MPI-based application, create an MPI project.
</p><p>
	<img src=\"/assets/165\" alt=\"New MPI project\">
</p><p>
	It is advisable not to use precompiled headers, so switch this setting off.
</p><p>
	Next, write your code. Once you are ready to debug or run your code, make the following adjustments to the project's properties in the 'Debugging' section.
</p><p>
	<img src=\"/assets/167\" alt=\"MPI project settings\">
</p><p>
	A few settings should be verified, and if necessary, modified:
</p><ol>
	<li>
	Make sure that the 'Debugger to lauch' is indeed the 'MPI Cluster Debugger'.</li>
	<li>
	The 'Run environment' is 'localhost/1' by default. Since this implies that only one MPI process will be started, it is not very exciting, so change it to, e.g., 'localhost/4' in order to have some parallel processes (4 in this example). Don not make this number too large, since the code will execute on your desktop machine.</li>
	<li>
	The 'MPIExec Command' should be pointed to 'mpiexec' that is found in the 'Bin' directory of the HPC Pack 2008 SDK installation directory.</li>
</ol><p>
	Debugging now proceeds as usual. One can switch between processes by selecting the main thread of the appropriate process by selecting the appropriate main thread in the Threads view.
