<h1>Next- generation Supercomputing in Flanders: value creation for your business!</h1><p><strong>Tuesday 27 Januari 2015</strong></p><p>Technopolis Mechelen<br>
</p><p>The first industry day was a success, thanks to all the presenters and participates. We especially would like to thank the minister for his presence. The success stories of European HPC centres showed how benificial HPC can be for all kinds of industry. The testimonials of the Flemish firms who already are using  large scale computing could only stress the importance HPC. We will continue to work on the ideas generated at this meeting so that VSC can strengthen its service to industry.
