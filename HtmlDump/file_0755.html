<p>Several of the software packages running on the UAntwerp cluster have restrictions in their licenses and cannot be used by all users. If a module does not load, it is very likely that you have no access to the package.</p><p>Access to such packages is managed by UNIX groups. You can request membership to the group, but that membership will only be granted if you are eligible for use of the package.</p><h2>ANSYS</h2><h2>CPMD</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.cpmd.org/\">CPMD</a> can be used for free for non-commercial research in education institutions under the <a href=\"http://cpmd.org/download/cpmd-licence\">CPMD Free License</a>.  </p><p>To get access:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cpmd.org/download/accept-license/cpmd-license-application\">Fill in the form for downloading CPMD</a> on the CPMD website. </li><li>You'll see a \"Thank You\" page confirming your submission.
