<h2>Prerequisites</h2><ul>	<li>macOS comes with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you don't need to install any third-party software to use it.  Just open a Terminal window and jump in!  Because of this, you can use the same commands as specified in the <a href=\"/client/linux\">Linux client section</a> to access the cluster and transfer files (<a href=\"/client/linux/keys-openssh\">ssh-keygen</a> to generate the keys, <a href=\"/client/linux/login-openssh\">ssh</a> to log on to the cluster and <a href=\"/client/linux/data-openssh\">scp and sftp</a> for file transfer).</li>
	<li>Optional: You can use <a href=\"http://www.m-works.co.nz/jellyfissh.php\" target=\"_blank\">JellyfiSSH</a> to store your ssh session settings.  The most recent version is available for a small fee from the Mac App Store, but if you <a href=\"https://www.google.be/webhp?ion=1&ie=UTF-8#q=JellyfiSSH+4.5.2\" target=\"_blank\">google for JellyfiSSH 4.5.2</a>, the version used for the screenshots in this page, you can still find some free downloads for that version. Installation is easy: just drag the program's icon to the Application folder in the Finder, and you're done.</li>
</ul><h2>Connecting using OpenSSH</h2><p>Like in the Linux client section, the ssh command is used to make a connection to (one of) the VSC clusters. In a Terminal window, execute:
</p><pre>$ ssh &lt;vsc-account&gt;@&lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;
</pre><p>where
</p><ul>
	<li>&lt;vsc-account&gt; is your VSC username that you have received by mail after your request was approved,</li>
	<li>&lt;vsc-loginnode&gt; is the name of the loginnode of the VSC cluster you want to connect to.</li>
</ul><p>You can find the names and ip-addresses of the loginnodes in the <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">sections of the local VSC clusters</a>.
</p><p>SSH will ask you to enter your passphrase.
</p><p>On sufficiently recent macOS/OS X versions (Leopard and newer) you can use the Keychain Access service to automatically provide your passphrase to ssh. All you need to do is to add the key using
</p><pre>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre><p>(assuming that your private key that <a href=\"/client/macosx/keys-openssh\">you generated before</a> is called id_rsa).
</p><h2>Using JellyfiSSH for bookmarking ssh connection settings</h2><p>You can use JellyfiSSH to create a user-friendly bookmark for your ssh connection settings. To do this, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
	<li>Start JellyfiSSH and select 'New'. This will open a window where you can specify the connection settings.</li>
	<li>
	In the 'Host or IP' field, type in &lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;. In the 'Login name' field, type in your &lt;vsc-account&gt;.<br>
	In the screenshot below we have filled in the fields for a connection to ThinKing cluster at KU Leuven as user vsc98765.<br>
	<img src=\"/assets/185\" alt=\"JellyfiSSH Connection Settings\" width=\"400\"></li>
	<li>You might also want to change the Terminal window settings, which can be done by clicking on the icon in the lower left corner of the JellyfiSSH window.</li>
	<li>When done, provide a name for the bookmark in the 'Bookmark Title' field and press 'Add' to create the bookmark.</li>
	<li>To make a connection, select the bookmark in the 'Bookmark' field and click on 'Connect'.  Optionally, you can make the bookmark the default by selecting it as the 'Startup Bookmark' in the JellyfiSSH &gt; Preferences menu entry.</li>
</ol>"
