<p>Jobs are submitted to a queue system, which is monitored by a scheduler that determines when a job can be executed.</p><p>The latter depends on two factors:</p><ol>    <li>the priority assigned to the job by the scheduler, and the priorities of the other jobs already in the queue, and</li>
    <li>the availability of the resources required to run the job.</li>
</ol><p>The priority of a job is calculated using a formula that takes into account a number of factors:</p><ol>
    <li>the user's credentials (at the moment, all users are equal)</li>
    <li>fair share: this takes into account the amount of walltime that the user has used over the last seven days, the more used, the lower the resulting priority</li>
    <li>time queued: the longer a job spends in the queue, the larger its priority becomes, so that it will run eventually</li>
    <li>requested resources: larger jobs get a higher priority</li>
</ol><p>These factors are used to compute a weighted sum at each iteration of the scheduler to determine a job's priority.  Due to the time queued and fair share, this is not static, but evolves over time while the job is in the queue.</p><p>Different clusters use different policies as some clusters are optimised for a particular type of job.</p><p>To get an idea when your job might start, you could try MOAB's 'showstart' command as described in the page on \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/running-jobs/submitting-managing-jobs\">Submitting and managing jobs with Torque and Moab</a>\".</p><p>Also, don't try to outsmart the scheduler by explicitly specifying nodes that seem empty when you launch your job. The scheduler may be saving these nodes for a job for which it needs multiple nodes, and the result will be that you will have to wait even longer before your job starts as the scheduler will not launch your job on another node which may be available sooner.</p><p>Remember that the cluster is not intended as a replacement for a decent desktop PC. Short, sequential jobs may spend quite some time in the queue, but this type of calculation is atypical from a HPC perspective. If you have large batches of (even relatively short) sequential jobs, you can still pack them as longer sequential or even parallel jobs and get to run them sooner. User support can help you with that.</p>"
