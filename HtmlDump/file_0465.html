<p>We organize regular trainings on many HPC-related topics. The level ranges fro introductory to advanced. We also actively promote some courses organised elsewhere. The courses are open to participants at the university associations. Many are also open to external users (the limitations often caused by software licenses of the packages used during hand-ons). For further info, you can contact the <a href=\"/en/about-vsc/contact\">course coordinator Geert Jan Bex</a>.</p>
