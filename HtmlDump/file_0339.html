<h2>Prerequisite: OpenSSH</h2><p>See <a href=\"/client/linux/keys-openssh\">the page on generating keys</a>.</p><h2>Connecting to the VSC clusters</h2><h3>Text mode</h3><p>In many cases, a text mode connection to one of the VSC clusters is sufficient. To make such a connection, the ssh command is used:
</p><pre>$ ssh &lt;vsc-account&gt;@&lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;
</pre><p>Here,
</p><ul>
	<li>&lt;vsc-account&gt; is your VSC username that you have received by mail after your request was approved,</li>
	<li>&lt;vsc-loginnode&gt; is the name of the loginnode of the VSC cluster you want to connect to.</li>
</ul><p><span class=\"visualHighlight\">You can find the names and ip-addresses of the loginnodes in the sections on the <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">available hardware</a>.</span>
</p><p>The first time you make a connection to the loginnode, you will be asked to verify the authenticity of the loginnode, e.g.,
</p><pre>$ ssh vsc98765@login.hpc.kuleuven.be
The authenticity of host 'login.hpc.kuleuven.be (134.58.8.192)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is b7:66:42:23:5c:d9:43:e8:b8:48:6f:2c:70:de:02:eb.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre><p>Here, user vsc98765 wants to make a connection to the ThinKing cluster at KU Leuven via the loginnode login.hpc.kuleuven.be.
</p><p>If your private key is not stored in a default file (~/.ssh/id_rsa) you need to provide the path to it while making the connection:</p><pre>$ ssh -i &lt;path-to-your-private-key-file&gt; &lt;vsc-account&gt;@&lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;</pre><h3>Connection with support for graphics</h3><p>On most clusters, we support a number of programs that have a GUI mode or display graphics otherwise through the X system. To be able to display the output of such a program on the screen of your Linux machine, you need to tell ssh to forward X traffic from the cluster to your Linux desktop/laptop by specifying the -X option. There is also an option -x to disable such traffic, depending on the default options on your system as specified in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, or ~/.ssh/config.<br>
	Example:
</p><pre>ssh -X vsc123456@login.hpc.kuleuven.be
</pre><p>To test the connection, you can try to start a simple X program on the login nodes, e.g., <code>xterm</code> or <code>xeyes</code>. The latter will open a new window with a pair of eyes. The pupils of these eyes should follow your mouse pointer around. Close the program by typing \"ctrl+c\": the window should disappear.
</p><p>If you get the error 'DISPLAY is not set', you did not correctly enable the X-Forwarding.
