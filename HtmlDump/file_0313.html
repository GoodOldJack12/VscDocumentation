<h2>Tier-1</h2><ul><li>Our <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-tier1-breniac\">current Tier-1 system is BrENIAC</a>, operated by KU Leuven. The system is aimed at large parallel computing jobs that require a high-bandwidth low-latency interconnect. Compute time is again only available upon approval of a project. See the <a href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/en/access-and-infrastructure/project-access-tier1\">page on Tier-1 project access and links in that page</a>.</li>
	<li>
	Our <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-tier1-muk\">first Tier-1 system is muk</a>, was operated by UGent but is no longer in production.</li>
</ul><h2>Experimental setup</h2><ul>
	<li>
	<a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/k20x-phi-hardware\">There is a small GPU and Xeon Phi test system</a> which is can be used by all VSC members on request (though a project approval is not required at the moment).
	<a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/k20x-phi-hardware\">The documentation for this system is under development</a>.
	</li>
</ul><h2>Tier-2</h2><p>Four university-level cluster groups are also embedded in the VSC and partly funded from VSC budgets:
</p><ul>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua\">The UAntwerpen clusters (hopper and leibniz)</a></li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-vub\">The VUB cluster (hydra)</a></li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ugent\">The UGent local clusters</a></li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-kul\">The KU Leuven/UHasselt cluster (ThinKing and Cerebro)</a></li>
</ul>"
