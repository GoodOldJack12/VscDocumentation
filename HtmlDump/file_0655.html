<p>A collaboration with the VSC offers your company a good number of benefits.</p><ul>
	<li>Together
we will identify which expertise within the Flemish universities and their
associations is appropriate for you when rolling out High Performance Computing
(HPC) within your company.
	</li>
	<li>We
can also assist with the technical writing of a project proposal for financing for example through  the IWT (Agency for
Innovation by Science and Technology).
	</li>
	<li>You
can participate in courses on HPC, including tailor-made courses provided by the VSC.
	</li>
	<li>You
will have access to a supercomputer infrastructure with a dedicated, on-site
team assisting you during the start-up phase.
	</li>
	<li>As
a software developer, you can also deploy HPC software technologies to develop
more efficient software which makes better use of modern hardware.
	</li>
	<li>A
shorter turnaround time for your simulation or data study boosts productivity
and increases the responsiveness of your business to new developments.
	</li>
	<li>The
possibility to carry out more detailed simulations or to analyse larger amounts
of data can yield new insights which in turn lead to improved products and more
efficient processes.
	</li>
	<li>A
quick analysis of the data collected during a production process helps to
detect and correct abnormalities early on.
	</li>
	<li>Numerical
simulation and virtual engineering reduce the number of prototypes and
accelerate the discovery of potential design problems. As a result you are able
to market a superior product faster and cheaper.
