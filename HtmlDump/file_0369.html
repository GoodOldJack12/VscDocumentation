<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	You should be familiar with subversion, either by reading the online subversion book, or, for the impatient, the <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/subversion\">documentation page on creating and using a subversion repository on the VSC clusters</a>.</li>
	<li>
	You should have (access to) a subversion repository on a VSC cluster, or any other repository (you should however be able to commit changes).</li>
	<li>
	A command line client for subversion, which is available all operating systems. For Windows, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.cygwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cygwin unix emulation layer</a> and the subversion packages included in it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Environment & general use</h2>
<p>
	All operations introduced in the <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/subversion\">documentation page on using subversion repositories on the VSC clusters</a> work as illustrated therein.  The repository's URI can be conveniently assigned to an environment variable
</p>
<pre>$ export SVN=\"svn+ssh://userid@vsc.login.node/data/leuven/300/vsc30000/svn-repo\"
</pre>
<p>
	where userid should be replaced by your own VSC user ID, and vsc.login.node to the appropriate login node for the cluster the repository is on.  In the above, it is assumed that the SVN repository you are going to use is in your VSC data directory (here shown for user vsc30000) and is called svn-repo.  This should be changed appropriately.
</p>
<h2>
Checking out a project from a VSC cluster repository</h2>
<p>
	To check out the simulation project to a directory 'simulation' on your desktop, simply type:
</p>
<pre>$ svn checkout  ${SVN}/simulation/trunk  simulation
</pre>
<p>
	The passphrase for your private key used to authenticate on the VSC cluster will be requested.
</p>
<p>
	Once the project is checked out, you can start editing or adding files and directories, committing your changes when done.
</p>
<h2>
Importing a local project into the VSC cluster repository</h2>
<p>
	Importing a project directory that is currently on your desktop and not on the VSC cluster is also possible, again by simply modifying the URLs in the previous section appropriately. Suppose the directory on your desktop is 'calculation', the steps to take are the following:
</p>
<pre>$ svn mkdir -m 'calculation: creating dirs' --parents   \\
            $SVN/calculation/trunk    \\
            $SVN/calculation/branches \\
            $SVN/calculation/tags
$ svn import -m 'calculation: import' \\
             calculation              \\
             $SVN/calculation/trunk
</pre>
<p>
	Note that each time you access the repository, you need to authenticate, which gets tedious pretty soon. Using ssh-agent may be considered to simplify life, see, e.g., a <a href=\"http://novosial.org/openssh/publickey-auth/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">short tutorial</a> on a possible setup.
