<h2>Inline code with &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;</h2><p>We used inline code on the old vscentrum.be to clearly mark system commands etc. in text.</p><ul>
	<li>For this we used the &lt;code&gt; tag.</li>
	<li>There was support in the editor to set this tag</li>
	<li>It doesn't seem to work properly in the current editor. If the fragment of code contains a slash (/), the closing tag gets omitted.</li>
</ul><p>Example: At UAntwerpen you'll have to use <code>module avail MATLAB</code> and 
	<code>module load MATLAB/2014a</code> respectively.
</p><p>However, If you enter both &lt;code&gt;-blocks on the same line in a HTML file, the editor doesn't process them well: <code>module avail MATLAB</code> and &lt;code&gt;module load MATLAB.
</p><p>Test: <code>test 1</code> en <code>test 2</code>.</p><h2>Code in &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</h2><p>This was used a lot on the old vscentrum.be site to display fragments of code or display output in a console windows.
</p><ul>
	<li>Readability of fragments is definitely better if a fixed width font is used as this is necessary to get a correct alignment.</li>
	<li>Formatting is important: Line breaks should be respected. The problem with the CMS seems to be that the editor respects the line breaks, the database also stores them as I can edit the code again, but the CMS removes them when generating the final HTML-page as I don't see the line breaks again in the resulting HTML-code that is loaded into the browser.</li>
</ul><pre>#!/bin/bash -l
#PBS -l nodes=1:nehalem
#PBS -l mem=4gb
module load matlab
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
...
</pre><p>And this is a test with a very long block:
</p><pre>ln03-1003: monitor -h
### usage: monitor [-d &lt;delta&gt;] [-l &lt;logfile&gt;] [-f &lt;files&gt;]
# [-h] [-v] &lt;cmd&gt; | -p &lt;pid&gt;
# Monitor can be used to sample resource utilization of a process
# over time. Monitor can sample a running process if the latter's PID
# is specified using the -p option, or it can start a command with
# parameters passed as arguments. When one has to specify flags for
# the command to run, '--' can be used to delimit monitor's options, e.g.,
# monitor -delta 5 -- matlab -nojvm -nodisplay calc.m
# Resources that can be monitored are memory and CPU utilization, as
# well as file sizes.
# The sampling resolution is determined by delta, i.e., monitor samples
# every &lt;delta&gt; seconds.
# -d &lt;delta&gt; : sampling interval, specified in
# seconds, or as [[dd:]hh:]mm:ss
# -l &lt;logfile&gt; : file to store sampling information; if omitted,
# monitor information is printed on stderr
# -n &lt;lines&gt; : retain only the last &lt;lines&gt; lines in the log file,
# note that this option only makes sense when combined
# with -l, and that the log file lines will not be sorted
# according to time
# -f &lt;files&gt; : comma-separated list of file names that are monitored
# for size; if a file doesn't exist at a given time, the
# entry will be 'N/A'
# -v : give verbose feedback
# -h : print this help message and exit
# &lt;cmd&gt; : actual command to run, followed by whatever
# parameters needed
# -p &lt;pid&gt; : process ID to monitor
#
# Exit status: * 65 for any montor related error
# * exit status of &lt;cmd&gt; otherwise
# Note: if the exit code 65 conflicts with those of the
# command to run, it can be customized by setting the
# environment variables 'MONITOR_EXIT_ERROR' to any value
# between 1 and 255 (0 is not prohibited, but this is probably.
# not what you want).
</pre><h2>The &lt;code&gt; style in the editor</h2><p>In fact, the Code style of the editor works on a paragraph basis and all it does is put the paragraph between &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;-tags, so the problem mentioned above remains. The next text was edited in WYSIWIG mode:
</p><pre>#!/bin/bash -l
#PBS -l nodes=4:ivybridge
...
</pre><p>Another editor bug is that it isn't possible to switch back to regular text mode at the end of a code fragment if that is at the end of the text widget: The whole block is converted back to regular text instead and the formatting is no longer shown.
