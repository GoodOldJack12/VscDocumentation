<h2>Prerequisite: OpenSSH</h2><p>
	Every macOS install comes with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you don't need to install any third-party software to use it.  Just open a Terminal window and jump in!  Because of this, you can use the same commands as specified in the <a href=\"/client/linux\">Linux client</a> section to access the cluster and transfer files.
</p><h2>
Generating a public/private key pair</h2><p>
	Generating a public/private key pair is identical to what is described in the <a href=\"/client/linux/keys-openssh\">Linux client</a> section, that is, by using the ssh-keygen command in a Terminal window.
