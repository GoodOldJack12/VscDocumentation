<p><br>4) Finally, save both the public and private keys in a secure place (i.e., a folder on your personal computer, or on your personal USB stick, ...) with the buttons 'Save public key' and 'Save private key'. We recommend to use the name \"id_rsa.pub\" for the public key, and \"id_rsa.ppk\" for the private key.</p><p><strong>If you use another program to generate a key pair, please remember that they need to be in the OpenSSH format to access the VSC clusters.</strong></p><h2><a id=\"PuTTY_to_OpenSSH\" name=\"PuTTY_to_OpenSSH\"></a>Converting PuTTY keys to OpenSSH format</h2><p>OpenSSH is a very popular command-line SSH client originating from the Linux world but now available on many operating systems. Therefore its file format is a very popular one. Some applications, such as Eclipse's SSH components, can not handle private keys generated with PuTTY, only OpenSSH compliant private keys. However, PuTTY's key generator 'PuTTYgen' (that was used to generate the public/private key pair in the first place) can be used to convert the PuTTY private key to one that can be used by Eclipse.</p><ol><li>Start PuTTYgen.</li><li>From the 'Conversions' menu, select 'Import key' and choose the file containing your PuTTY private key that is used to authenticate on the VSC cluster.</li><li>When prompted, enter the appropriate passphrase.</li><li>From the 'Conversions' menu, select 'Export OpenSSH key' and save it as 'id_rsa' (or any other name if the former already exists). Remember the file name and its location, it will have to be specified in the configuration process of, e.g., Eclipse.</li><li>Exit PuTTYgen.</li></ol>
