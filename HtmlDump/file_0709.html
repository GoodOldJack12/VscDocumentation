	<li><a href=\"/cluster-doc/running-jobs/worker-framework\">Worker framework</a>: To manage lots of small jobs on a cluster. The cluster scheduler isn't meant to deal with tons of small jobs. Those create a lot of overhead, so it is better to bundle those jobs in larger sets.</li>
	<li>The <a href=\"/cluster-doc/running-jobs/checkpointing-framework\">checkpointing framework</a> can be used to run programs that take longer than the maximum time allowed by the queue. It can break a long job in shorter jobs, saving the state at the end to automatically start the next job from the point where the previous job was interrupted.</li><li>Running jobs on GPU or Xeon Phi nodes: The procedure is not standardised across the VSC, so we refer to the pages for each cluster in the \"<a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">Available hardware</a>\" section of this web site<ul><li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/k20x-phi-hardware\">KU Leuven GPU and Xeon Phi nodes</a></li></ul></li>
