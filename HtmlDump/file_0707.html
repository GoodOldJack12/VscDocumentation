<h2>Submitting your job: the qsub command</h2><p>Once your job script is finished, you submit it to the scheduling system using the <code>qsub</code> command:</p><pre>qsub &lt;jobscript&gt;
</pre><p>places your job script in the queue. As explained on the page on \"<a href=\"cluster-doc/running-jobs/specifying-requirements\">Specifying resources, output files and notifications</a>\", there are several options to tell the scheduler which resources you need or how you want to be notified of events surrounding your job. The can be given at the top of your job script or as additional command line options to <code>qsub</code>. In case both are used, options given on the command line take precedence over the specifications in the job script. E.g., if a different number of nodes and cores is requested through a command line option then specified in the job script, the specification on the command line will be used.
</p><h3>Starting interactive jobs</h3><p>Though our clusters are mainly meant to be used for batch jobs, there are some facilities for interactive work:
</p><ul>
	<li>The login nodes can be used for light interactive work. They can typically run the same software as the compute nodes. Some sites also have special interactive nodes for special tasks, e.g., scientific data visualisation. See the \"<a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">Available hardware</a>\" section where each site documents what is available.<br>Examples of work that can be done on the login nodes is running a GUI program that generates the input files for your simulation, a not too long compile, a quick and not very resource intensive visualisation. We have set limits on the amount of time a program can use on the login nodes.</li>
	<li>It is also possible to request one or more compute nodes for interactive work. This is also done through the <code>qsub</code> command. In this case, you can still use a job script to specify the resources, but the most common case is to specify them at the command line.</li>
</ul><p>In the latter scenario, two options of <code>qsub</code> are particularly useful: <code>-I</code> to request an node for interactive use, and <code>-X</code> to add support for X to the request. You would typically also add several <code>-l</code> options to specify for how long you need the node and the amount of resources that you need. E.g.,
</p><pre>qsub -I -l walltime=2:00:00 -l nodes=1:ppn=20
</pre><p>to use 20 cores on a single node for 2 hours. <code>qsub</code> will block until it gets a node and then you get the command prompt for that node. If the wait is too long however, <code>qsub</code> will return with an error message and you'll need to repeat the call.
</p><p>If you want to run programs that use X in your interactive job, you have to add the -X option to the above command. This will set up the forwarding of X traffic to the login node, and ultimately to your terminal if you have set up the connection to the login node properly for X support.
</p><p>Please remain reasonable in your request for interactive resources. On some clusters, a short waltime will give you a higher priority, and on most clusters a request for a multi-day interactive session will fail simply because the cluster cannot give you such a node before the time-out of <code>qsub</code> kicks in. Interactive use of nodes is mostly meant for debugging, for large compiles or larger visualisations on clusters that don't have dedicated nodes for visualisation.</p><h2>Viewing your jobs in the queue: qstat and showq
</h2><p>Two commands can be used to show your jobs in the queue:
</p><ul>
	<li><code>qstat</code> show the queue from the resource manager's perspective. It doesn't know about priorities, only about requested resources and the state of your job: Still idle and waiting for resources, running, finishing, ...</li>
	<li><code>showq</code> shows the queue from the scheduler's perspective, taking priorities and policies into account.</li>
</ul><p>Both commands will also show you the name of the queue (<code>qstat</code>) or class (<code>showq</code>) which in most cases is actually the same as the queue. All VSC clusters have multiple queues. Queues are used to define policies for each cluster. E.g., users may be allowed to have a lot of short jobs running simultaneously as they will finish soon anyway, but may be limited to a few multi-day jobs to avoid long-time monopolisation of a cluster by a single user, and this would typically be implemented by having separate queues with separate policies for short and long jobs. When you submit a job, <code>qsub</code> will put the job in a particular queue based on the resources requested. The <code>qsub</code> command does allow to specify the queue to use, but unless instructed to do so by user support, we strongly advise against using this option. Putting the job in the wrong queue may actually result in your job being refused by the queue manager, and we may also chose to change the available queues on a system to implement new policies.<br>
</p><h3>qstat</h3><p>On the VSC clusters, users will only receive a subset of the options that <code>qsub</code> offers. The output is always restricted to the user's jobs only.
</p><p>To see your jobs in the queue, enter
</p><pre>qstat
</pre><p>This will give you an overview of all jobs including their status, which includes queues but not yet running (Q), running (R) or finishing (C).
</p><pre>qstat &lt;jobid&gt;
</pre><p>where &lt;jobid&gt; is the number of the job, will show you the information about this job only.
</p><p>Several command line options can be specified to modify the output of <code>qstat</code>:
</p><ul>
	<li><code>qstat -i</code> will show you a bit more information.</li>
	<li><code>qstat -n</code> will also show you the nodes allocated to each running job.</li>
	<li><code>qstat -f</code> or <code>qstat -f1</code> produces even more output. In fact, it produces so much output that it is better only used with the job ID as an argument to request information about a specific job.</li>
</ul><h3>showq</h3><p>The <code>showq</code> command will show you information about the queue from the scheduler's perspective. Jobs are subdivided in three categories:
</p><ul>
	<li>The active jobs are the jobs that are actually running, or are being started or terminated.</li>
	<li>Eligible jobs are jobs that are queued and considered eligible for scheduling. </li>
	<li>Blocked jobs are jobs that are ineligible to run or to be queued for scheduling. There are multiple reasons why a job might be in the blocked state.
	<ul>
		<li>If the status is marked as idle, your job most likely violates a fairness policy, i.e., you've used too many resources recently.</li>
		<li>BatchHold: Either the cluster has repeatedly failed to start the job (which typically is a problem with the cluster, so contact user support if you see this happen) or your resource request cannot be granted on the cluster. This is also the case if you try to put more jobs in a queue than you are allowed to have queued or running at any particular moment.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>deferred: a temporary hold after a failed start attempt, but the system will have another try at starting the job.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>UserHold or SystemHold: The user or the system administrator has put a hold on the job (and it is is up to him/her to also release that hold again).</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>NotQueued: The job has not been queued for some other reason.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>The <code>showq</code> command will split its output according to the three major categories. Active jobs are sorted according to their expected end time while eligible jobs are sorted according to their current priority.
</p><p>There are also some useful options:
</p><ul>
	<li><code>showq -r</code> will show you the running jobs only, but will also give more information about these jobs, including an estimate about how efficiently they are using the CPU.</li>
	<li><code>showq -i </code>will give you more information about your eligible jobs.</li>
</ul><h2>Getting detailed information about a job: qstat -f and checkjob </h2><p>We've discussed the Torque <code>qstat -f</code> command already in the previous section. It gives detailed information about a job from the resource manager's perspective.
</p><p>The <code>checkjob</code> command does the same, but from the perspective of the scheduler, so the information that you get is different.
</p><pre>checkjob 323323
</pre><p>will produce information about the job with jobid 323323.
</p><pre>checkjob -v 323323
</pre><p>where -v stands for verbose produces even more information.
</p><p>For a running job, checkjob will give you an overview of the allocated resources and the wall time consumed so far. For blocked jobs, the end of the output typically contains clues about why a job is blocked.
</p><h2>Deleting a job that is queued or running</h2><p>This is easily done with <code>qdel</code>:</p><pre>qdel 323323</pre><p>will delete the job with job ID 323323. If the job is already running, the processes will be killed and the resources will be returned to the scheduler for another job.</p><h2>Getting an estimate for the start time of your job: showstart</h2><p>This is a very simple tool that will tell you, based on the current status of the cluster, when your job is scheduled to start. Note however that this is merely an estimate, and should not be relied upon: jobs can start sooner if other jobs finish early, get removed, etc., but jobs can also be delayed when other jobs with higher priority are submitted.
</p><pre>$ showstart 20030021
job 20030021 requires 896 procs for 1:00:00
Earliest start in       5:20:52:52 on Tue Mar 24 07:36:36
Earliest completion in  5:21:52:52 on Tue Mar 24 08:36:36
Best Partition: DEFAULT
</pre><p>Note however that this is only an estimate, starting from the jobs that are currently running or in the queue and the wall time that users gave for these jobs. Jobs may always end earlier than predicted based on the requested wall time, so your job may start earlier. But other jobs with a higher priority may also enter the queue and delay the start from your job.</p><h2>See if there is are free resources that you might use for a short job: showbf</h2><p>When the scheduler performs its scheduling task, there is bound to be some gaps between jobs on a node. These gaps can be back filled with small jobs. To get an overview of these gaps, you can execute the command <code>showbf</code>:</p><pre>$ showbf
backfill window (user: 'vsc30001' group: 'vsc30001' partition: ALL) Wed Mar 18 10:31:02
323 procs available for      21:04:59
136 procs available for   13:19:28:58</pre><p>There is however no guarantee that if you submit a job that would fit in the available resources, it will also run immediately. Another user might be doing the same thing at the same time, or you may simply be blocked from running more jobs because you already have too many jobs running or have made heavy use of the cluster recently.</p><p><br></p>"
