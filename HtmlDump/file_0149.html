<p>We offer you the opportunity of a free trial of the Tier-1 to prepare a future regular Tier-1 project application. You can test if your software runs well on the Tier-1 and do the scalability tests that are required for a project application.</p><p>If you want to check if buying compute time on our infrastructure is an option, we offer a <a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/access-industry\">very similar free programme for a test ride</a>.</p><h2>Characteristics of a Starting Grant</h2><ul>
	<li>The maximum amount is 100 nodedays.</li>
	<li>The maximal allowed period to use the compute time is 2 months.</li>
	<li>The allocation is personal and can't be transferred or shared with other researchers.</li>
	<li>Requests can be done at any time, there are no cutoff days.</li>
	<li>The use of this compute time is free of charge.</li>
</ul><h2>Procedure to apply and grant the request</h2><ol>
	<li>Download the <u><a href=\"/assets/1331\">application form for a starting grant version 2018 (docx, 31 kB)</a>.</u></li>
	<li>Send the completed application by e-mail to the Tier-1 contact address (<a href=\"mailto:hpcinfo@icts.kuleuven.be\">hpcinfo@icts.kuleuven.be</a>), with your local VSC coordinator in cc.</li>
	<li>The request will be judged for its validity by the Tier-1 coordinator.</li>
	<li>After approval the Tier-1 coordinator will give you access and compute time.<br>If not approved, you will get an answer with a motivation for the decision.</li>
	<li>The granted requests are published on the VSC website. Therefore you need to provide a short abstract in the application.<span></span></li>
