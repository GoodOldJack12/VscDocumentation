<h2><a name=\"intro\"></a>Introduction &amp; motivation</h2><p>When working on the command line such as in the Bash shell, applications support command line flags and parameters. Many programming languages offer support to conveniently deal with command line arguments out of the box, e.g., Python. However, quite a number of languages used in a scientific context, e.g., C/C++, Fortran, R, Matlab do not. Although those languages offer the necessary facilities, it is at best somewhat cumbersome to use them, and often the process is rather error prone.</p><p>Quite a number of libraries have been developed over the years that can be used to conveniently handle command line arguments. However, this complicates the deployment of the application since it will have to rely on the presence of these libraries.
</p><p>ParameterWeaver has a different approach: it generates the necessary code to deal with the command line arguments of the application in the target language, so that these source files can be distributed along with those of the application. This implies that systems that don't have ParameterWeaver installed still can run that application.
</p><p>Using ParameterWeaver is as simple as writing a definition file for the command line arguments, and executing the code generator via the command lnie. This can be conveniently integrated into a standard build process such as make.
</p><p>ParameterWeaver currently supports the following target languages:
</p><ul>
	<li>C/C++</li>
	<li>Fortran 90</li>
	<li>R</li>
</ul><h2><a name=\"overview\"></a>High-level overview &amp; concepts</h2><h3>Parameter definition files</h3><p>A parameter definition file is a CSV text file where each line defines a parameter. A parameter has a type, a name, a default values, and optionally, a description. To add documentation, comments can be added to the definition file. The types are specific to the target language, e.g., an integer would be denoted by <tt>int</tt> for C/C++, and by <tt>integer</tt> for Fortran 90. The supported types are documented for each implemented target language.
</p><p>By way of illustration, a parameter definition file is given below for C as a target language, additional examples are shown in the target language specific sections:
</p><pre>int,numParticles,1000,number of particles in the system
double,temperature,273,system temperature in Kelvin
char*,intMethod,'newton',integration method to use
</pre><p>Note that this parameter definition file should be viewed as an integral part of the source code.
</p><h3>Code generation</h3><p>ParameterWeaver will generate code to
</p><ol>
	<li>initialize the parameter variables to the default values as specified in the parameter definition file;</li>
	<li>parse the actual command line arguments at runtime to determine the user specified values, and</li>
	<li>print the values of the parameters to an output stream.</li>
</ol><p>The implementation and features of the resulting code fragments are specific to the target language, and try to be as close as possible to the idioms of that language. Again, this is documented for each target language specifically. The nature and number of these code fragments varies from one target language to the other, again trying to match the language's idioms as closely as possible. For C/C++, a declaration file (<tt>.h</tt>) and a definition file (<tt>.c</tt>), while for Fortran 90 a single file (<tt>.f90</tt> will be generated that contains both declarations and definitions.
</p><h2><a name=\"language-specific\"></a>Language specific documentation</h2><h3>C/C++ documentation</h3><h4>Data types</h4><p>For C/C++, ParameterWeaver supports the following data types:
</p><ol>
	<li><tt>int</tt></li>
	<li><tt>long</tt></li>
	<li><tt>float</tt></li>
	<li><tt>double</tt></li>
	<li><tt>bool</tt></li>
	<li><tt>char *</tt></li>
</ol><h4>Example C program</h4><p>Suppose we want to pass command line parameters to the following C program:
</p><pre>#include 
#include 
#include 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    FILE *fp;
    int i;
    if (strlen(out) &gt; 0) {
        fp = fopen(out, \"w\");
    } else {
        fp = stdout;
    }
    if (verbose) {
        fprintf(fp, \"# n = %d\\n\", n);
        fprintf(fp, \"# alpha = %.16f\\n\", alpha);
        fprintf(fp, \"# out = '%s'\\n\", out);
        fprintf(fp, \"# verbose = %s\\n\", verbose);
    }
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        fprintf(fp, \"%d\\t%f\\n\", i, i*alpha);
    }
    if (fp != stdout) {
        fclose(fp);
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre><p>We would like to set the number of iterations <tt>n</tt>, the factor <tt>alpha</tt>, the name of the file to write the output to <tt>out</tt> and the verbosity <tt>verbose</tt> at runtime, i.e., without modifying the source code of this program.
</p><p>Moreover, the code to print the values of the variables is error prone, if we later add or remove a parameter, this part of the code has to be updated as well.
</p><p>Defining the command line parameters in a parameter definition file to automatically generate the necessary code simplifies matters considerably.
</p><h4>Example parameter definition file</h4><p>The following file defines four command line parameters named <tt>n</tt>, <tt>alpha</tt>, <tt>out</tt> and <tt>verbose</tt>. They are to be interpreted as <tt>int</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, <tt>char</tt> pointer and <tt>bool</tt> respectively, and if no values are passed via the command line, they will have the default values <tt>10</tt>, <tt>0.19</tt>, <tt>output.txt</tt> and false respectively. Note that a string default value is quoted. In this case, the columns in the file are separated by tab characters. The following is the contents of the parameter definition file <tt>param_defs.txt</tt>:
</p><pre>int n   10
double  alpha   0.19
char *  out 'output.txt'
bool    verbose false
</pre><p>This parameter definition file can be created in a text editor such as the one used to write C program, or from a Microsoft Excel worksheet by saving the latter as a CSV file.
</p><p>As mentioned above, boolean values are also supported, however, the semantics is slightly different from other data types. The default value of a logical variable is always false, regardless of what is specified in the parameter definition file. As opposed to parameters of other types, a logical parameter acts like a flag, i.e., it is a command line options that doesn't take a value. Its absence is interpreted as false, its presence as true. Also note that using a parameter of type <tt>bool</tt> implies that the program will have to be complied as C99, rather than C89. All modern cmopiler fully support C99, so that should not be an issue. However, if your program needs to adhere strictly to the C89 standard, simply use a parameter of type <tt>int</tt> instead, with <tt>0</tt> interpreted as false, all other values as true. In that case, the option takes a value on the command line.
</p><h4>Generating code</h4><p>Generating the code fragments is now very easy. If appropriate, load the module (VIC3):
</p><pre>$ module load parameter-weaver
</pre><p>Next, we generate the code based on the parameter definition file:
</p><pre>$ weave -l C -d param_defs.txt
</pre><p>A number of type declarations and functions are generated, the declarations in the header file <tt>cl_params.h</tt>, the defintions in the source file <tt>cl_params.c</tt>.
</p><ol>
	<li>data structure: a type <tt>Params</tt> is defined as a <tt>typedef</tt> of a <tt>struct</tt> with the parameters as fields, e.g.,
	<pre>typedef struct {
    int n;
    double alpha;
    char *out;
    bool verbose;
} Params;
    </pre>
	</li>
	<li>Initialization function: the default values of the command line parameters are assigned to the fields of the <tt>Params</tt> variable, the address of which is passed to the function</li>
	<li>Parsing: the options passed to the program via the command line are assigned to the appropriate fields of the <tt>Params</tt> variable. Moreover, the <tt>argv</tt> array containing the remaining command line arguments, the <tt>argc</tt> variable is set apprppriately.</li>
	<li>Dumper: a function is defined that takes three arguments: a file pointer, a prefix and the address of a <tt>Params</tt> variable. This function writes the values of the command line parameters to the file pointer, each on a separate line, preceeded by the specified prefix.</li>
	<li>Finalizer: a function that deallocates memory allocated in the initialization or the parsing functions to avoid memory leaks.</li>
</ol><h4>Using the code fragments</h4><p>The declarations are simply included using preprocessor directives:
</p><pre>  #include \"cl_params.h\"
</pre><p>A variable to hold the parameters has to be defined and its values initialized:
</p><pre>  Params params;
  initCL(&amp;params);
</pre><p>Next, the command line parameters are parsed and their values assigned:
</p><pre>  parseCL(&amp;params, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);
</pre><p>The dumper can be called whenever the user likes, e.g.,
</p><pre>  dumpCL(stdout, \"\", &amp;params);
</pre><p>The code for the program is thus modified as follows:
</p><pre>#include 
#include 
#include 
#include \"cl_params.h\"
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    FILE *fp;
    int i;
    Params params;
    initCL(&amp;params);
    parseCL(&amp;params, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    if (strlen(params.out) &gt; 0) {
        fp = fopen(params.out, \"w\");
    } else {
        fp = stdout;
    }
    if (params.verbose) {
        dumpCL(fp, \"# \", &amp;params);
    }
    for (i = 0; i &lt; params.n; i++) {
        fprintf(fp, \"%d\\t%f\\n\", i, i*params.alpha);
    }
    if (fp != stdout) {
        fclose(fp);
    }
    finalizeCL(&amp;params);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre><p>Note that in this example, additional command line parameters are simply ignored. As mentioned before, they are available in the array <tt>argv</tt>, <tt>argv[0]</tt> will hold the programs name, subsequent elements up to <tt>argc - 1</tt> contain the remaining command line parameters.
