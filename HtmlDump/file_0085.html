<p>The best way to get a complete list of all available software in a particular cluster can be obtained by typing:</p><pre>$ module av</pre><p>In order to use those software packages, the user should work with the <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules\">module system</a>. On the newer systems, we use the same naming conventions for packages on all systems. Due to the ever expanding list of packages, we've also made some adjustments and don't always show all packages, so be sure to check out the page on <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules\">the module system</a> again to <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules#getting-more-software\">learn how you can see more packages</a>.</p><p><em>Note: Since August 2016, a <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod\">different implementation of the module system has been implemented on the UGent and VUB Tier-2 systems</a>, called Lmod. Though highly compatible with the system used on the other clusters, it offers <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod#commands\">a lot of new commands</a>, and <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod#Advantages-differences\">some key differences</a>.</em><br></p><ul><li>As not everybody has access to the Tier-1 system Muk, here is an <a href=\"/cluster-doc/software/tier1-muk\">overview of the currently installed software on that system</a>.</li></ul><h2>Packages with additional documentation</h2><ul>    <li>Matlab (a package by <a href=\"https://nl.mathworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">The MathWorks</a>)

    <li>Some programming languages have an extensive standard library, but optionally allow to install extra packages. For most languages, the user can install packages in his own home directory without system administrator intervention. Some documentation for doing this for <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/perl-packages\">Perl</a> and <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/python-packages\">Python</a> is provided.</li>
