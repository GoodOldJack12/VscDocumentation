<p>To display graphical applications from a Linux computer (such as the VSC clusters) on your Windows desktop, you need to install an X Window server.  Here we describe the installation of Xming, one such server and freely available.</p><h2>Installing Xming</h2><ol>    <li>Download the Xming installer from <a href=\"http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/\" target=\"_blank\">the XMing web site</a>. </li>
    <li>Either install Xming from the <strong>Public Domain Releases</strong> (free) or from the <strong>Website Releases</strong> (after a donation) on the website.</li>
    <li>Run the Xming setup program on your Windows desktop.   Make sure to select 'XLaunch wizard' and 'Normal PuTTY Link SSH client'.<br>

</ol><h2><br>
Running Xming:</h2><ol>
    <li>To run Xming, select XLaunch from the Start Menu.</li>
    <li>Select 'Multiple Windows'. This will open each application in a separate window.<br>
    <img src=\"/assets/155\" alt=\"Xming-Display.png\"></li>
    <li>Select 'Start no client' to make XLaunch wait for other programs (such as PuTTY).<br>

    <li>Select 'Clipboard' to share the clipboard.<br>

    <li>Finally save the configuration.<br>

    <li>Now Xming is running ... and you can launch a graphical application in your PuTTY terminal. Do not forget to enable X11 forwarding as explained on <a href=\"/client/windows/console-putty\">our PuTTY page</a>.<br>
    To test the connection, you can try to start a simple X program on the login nodes, e.g., xterm or xeyes. The latter will open a new window with a pair of eyes. The pupils of these eyes should follow your mouse pointer around. Close the program by typing \"ctrl+c\": the window should disappear.<br>
    If you get the error 'DISPLAY is not set', you did not correctly enable the X-Forwarding.</li>
