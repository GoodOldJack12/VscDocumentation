<h2>Purpose</h2><p>Here it is shown how to use Rscript and pass arguments to an R script.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the use of R as well as R scripting, and is familiar wth the linux bash shell.</p><h2>Using Rscript and command line arguments</h2><p>When performing computation on the cluster using R, it is necessary to run those scripts from the command line, rather than interactively using R's graphical user interface.  Consider the following R function that is defined in, e.g., 'logistic.R':</p><pre>logistic &lt;- function(r, x) {    r*x*(1.0 - x)
}</pre><p>From R's GUI interface, you typically use this from the console as follows:</p><pre>&gt; source(\"logistic.R\")
&gt; logistic(3.2, 0.5)</pre><p>It is trivial to write an R script 'logistic-wrapper.R' that can be run from the command line, and that takes to arguments, the first being 'r', the second 'x'.</p><pre>args &lt;- commandArgs(TRUE)
r &lt;- as.double(args[1])
x &lt;- as.double(args[2])

source(\"logistic.R\")

logistic(r, x)</pre><p>The first line of this script stores all arguments passed to the script in the array 'args.  The second (third) line converts the first (second) element of that array from a string to a double precision number using the function 'as.double', and stores it into r (x).</p><p>Now from the linux command line, one can run the script above for r = 3.2 and x = 0.5 as follows:</p><pre>$ Rscript logistic-wrapper.R 3.2 0.5</pre><p>Note that you should have loaded the appropriate R module, e.g.,</p><pre>$ module load R</pre><p>Suppose now that the script needs to be extended to iterate the logistic map 'n' times, where the latter value is passed as the third argument to the script.</p><pre>args &lt;- commandArgs(TRUE)
r &lt;- as.double(args[1])
x &lt;- as.double(args[2])
n &lt;- as.integer(args[3])

source(\"logistic.R\")

for (i in 1:n) x &lt;- logistic(r, x)
print(x)</pre><p>Note that since the the third argument represents the number of iterations, it should be interpreted as an integer value, and hence be converted appropriately using the function 'as.integer'.</p><p>The script is now invoked from the linux command line with three parameters as follows:</p><pre>$ Rscript cl.R 3.2 0. 5 100</pre><p>Note that if you pass an argument that is to be interpreted as a string in your R program, no conversion is needed, e.g.,</p><pre>name &lt;- args[4]</pre><p>Here it is assumed that the 'name' is passed as the fourth command line argument.</p>"
