<p>Leibniz has two compute nodes each equipped with two NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU compute cards, the most powerful cards available at the time of installation of the system. We run the regular NVIDIA software stack on those systems</p><p>The main goal of the system is to assess the performance of GPUs for applications used by our researchers. We want to learn for which applications GPU computing is economically viable. Users should realise that these nodes carry three times the cost of a regular compute node and might also be shorter lived (in the past, some NVIDA GPUs have shown to be pretty fragile). So these nodes are only interesting and should only be used for applications that run three times faster than a regular CPU-based equivalent.
</p><p>As such we offer precedence to users who want to work with us towards this goal and either develop high-quality GPU software or are willing to benchmark their application on GPU and regular CPUs.
</p><h2>Getting access</h2><p>Contact <a href=\"/support/contact-support\">the UAntwerp support team</a> to get access to the Xeon Phi node.
</p><p>Users of the GPU compute nodes are expected to report back on their experiences. We are most interested in users who can also compare with running on regular nodes as we will use this information for future purchase decisions.
</p><p>Currently the nodes are not yet integrated in the job system, you can log on manually to the node but need to check if noone else is using the node.
</p><h2>Monitoring GPU nodes</h2><p>Monitoring of CPU use by jobs running on the GPU nodes can be done in the same way as for regular compute nodes.
</p><p>One useful command to monitor the use of the GPUs is <code>nvidia-smi</code>. It will show information on both GPUs in the GPU node, and among others lets you easily verify if the GPUs are used by the job.
</p><h2>Software on the GPU</h2><p>Software is installed on demand. As these systems are new to us also, we do expect some collaboration of the user to get software running on the GPUs.
