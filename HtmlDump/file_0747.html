<p>From version 2017a on of the Intel toolchains, the setup on the UAntwerp is different from the one on some other VSC clusters:</p><ul>
	<li>A full install of all Intel tools for which we have a license at UAntwerp has been performed in a single directory tree as intended by Intel. There is a single module for the C/C++/Fortran compilers, Intel MPI, the libraries MKL (Math Kernel Library), IPP (Integrated Performance Primitives), TBB (Threading Building Blocks) and DAAL (Data Analytics Acceleration Library) and Intel-provided GDB-based debuggers. The Intel tools for code and performance analysis VTune Amplifier XE, Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector (ITAC), Intel Advisor XE and Intel Inspector XE are also installed, but these still have separate module files as they rely on overloading libraries in some cases.</li>
	<li>There should be no need to run any of the configuration scripts provided by Intel, all variables should be set correctly by the module file. Contact user support if this is not the case. The configuration scripts should work as intended by Intel though should you want to use the compilers without loading the module.</li>
	<li>Several variables specific for the way software is set up at the VSC are defined the way they would be defined if the Intel toolchain was defined in the standard VSC way through the module tree. As such, we expect that you should be able to use any Makefile developed for the standard VSC-setup.</li>
	<li>All compiler components needed to develop applications with offload to a Xeon Phi expansion board are also provided in anticipation of the installation of such a cluster node for testing purposes in Leibniz.</li>
</ul><h2>Compilers</h2><ul>
	<li>The compilers work exactly in the way described on <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-intel\">the regular Intel toolchain web page</a>, including the MPI compiler wrappers. All links to the documentation on that page are also relevant.</li>
	<li>Man pages for all commands have also been installed.</li>
</ul><h2>Debuggers</h2><ul>
	<li>Intel-adapted GDB debuggers have been installed
	<ul>
		<li>Debugging regular Intel64 applications: <code>gdb-ia</code></li>
		<li>Debugging applications with offload to Xeon Phi: <code>gdb-mic</code></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Manual pages and GNU info pages are available for both commands</li>
</ul><h2>Libraries</h2><h3>Math Kernel Library (MKL)</h3><p>MKL works exactly as in the regular VSC Intel toolchain. See <a href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-intel#intel-mathematical-libraries\">the MKL section of web page on the VSC Intel toolchain</a> for more information.
</p><h3>Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)</h3><ul>
	<li>What? The Intel Integrated Performance Primitives is a software library that provides a broad range of functionality, including general signal and image processing, computer vision, data compression, cryptography, and string manipulation. The functions are heavily optimised for the Intel processors.</li>

	</ul></li>
</ul><h3>Threading Building Blocks (TBB)</h3><ul>
	<li>What? A C++ template library for task parallelism. The library is developed by Intel, but now available under the Apache 2.0 license and runs also with non-Intel compilers, so you don't have to be concerned about vendor lock-in.</li>

	</ul></li>
</ul><h3>Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL)</h3><ul>
	<li>What? A library with building blocks covering all stages of data analytics: data acquisition from a data source, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, modeling, validation, and decision making. The implementation is heavily optimised for Intel processors.</li>

</ul><h2>Code and performance analysis</h2><h3>VTune Amplifier XE</h3><ul>
	<li>What? VTune Amplifier is a tool for runtime analysis of serial and shared memory applications. For a list of features, please consult the <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-vtune\">Getting Started with VTune web page</a>.</li>
	<li>Module: <code>VTune/&lt;toolchain version&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>VTune/2017a</code>.</li>
	<li>How? VTune Amplifier is started through the <code>amplxe-gui</code> (GUI version) or <code>amplxe-cl</code> (command line version) command.</li>
	<li>Documentation:

	</ul></li>
</ul><h3>ITAC - Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector</h3><ul>
	<li>What? ITAC is a graphical tool to understand MPI application behaviour. A full set of features can be found on the <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-itac\">Getting Started with Intel Trace Analyzer and Colllector page</a>.</li>
	<li>How? Analysis is a two-step operation:
	<ol>
		<li>Run your application using the <code>-trace</code> option of mpirun to collect data in a <code>.stf</code> file.</li>
		<li>Analyse the data using <code>traceanalyzer</code></li>
