		<h2>Total disk space used on filesystems with quota</h2>
		<p>On filesystems with 'quota enabled', you can check the amount of disk space that is available for you, and the amount of disk space that is in use by you. Unfortunately, there is not a single command that will give you that information for all file systems in the VSC.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>quota</code> is the standard command to request your disk quota. Its output is in 'blocks', but can also be given in MB/GB if you use the '-s' option.</li>
			<li>But it does not work on GPFS file systems. On those you have to use <code>mmlsquota</code>. This is the case for the scratch space at the KU Leuven or on the Tier-1.</li>
			<li>On some clusters, these commands are currently disabled.</li>
			<li>Also, using these commands on another cluster than the one in your home institution, will fail to return information about the quota on your VSC_HOME and VSC_DATA directories and will show you the quota for your VSC_SCRATCH directory on that system.</li>
		</ul>
		<pre>quota -s
Disk quotas for user vsc31234 (uid 123456):
  Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
nas2-ib1:/mnt/home
                648M   2919M   3072M            3685       0       0
nas2-ib1:/mnt/data
              20691M  24320M  25600M            134k       0       0
nas1-ib1:/mnt/site_scratch
                   0  24320M  25600M               1       0       0<br>
		</pre>
		<p>Each line represents a file system you have access to, $VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, and, for this particular example, $VSC_SCRATCH_SITE. The blocks column shows your current usage, quota is the usage above which you will be warned, and limit is \"hard\", i.e., when your usage reaches this limit, no more information can be written to the file system, and programs that try will fail.</p><p>Some file systems have limits on the number of files that can be stored, and those are represented by the last four columns. The number of files you currently have is listed in the column files, quota and limit represent the soft and hard limits for the number of files.</p>

		<h2>Diskspace used by individual directories</h2>
		<p>The command to check the size of all subdirectories in the current directory is \"du\":
		</p>
		<pre>$ du -h
4.0k      ./.ssh
0       ./somedata/somesubdir
52.0k   ./somedata
56.0k   .
		</pre>
		<p>This shows you first the aggregated size of all subdirectories, and finally the total size of the current directory \".\" (this includes files stored in the current directory). The -h option ensures that sizes are displayed in human readable form, omitting it will show sizes in bytes.</p>
		<p>If the number of lower level subdirectories starts to grow too big, you may not want to see the information at that depth; you could just ask for a summary of the current directory:
		</p>
		<pre>du -s 
54864 .<br>
		</pre>
		<p>If you want to see the size of any file or top level subdirectory in the current directory, you could use the following command:
		</p>
		<pre>du -s *
12      a.out
3564    core
4       mpd.hosts
51200   somedata
4       start.sh
4       test
		</pre>
		<p>Finally, if you don't want to know the size of the data in your current directory, but in some other directory (eg. your data directory), you just pass this directory as a parameter. If you also want this size to be \"human readable\" (and not always the total number of kilobytes), you add the parameter \"-h\":
		</p>
		<pre>du -h -s $VSC_DATA/*
50M     /data/leuven/300/vsc30001/somedata
