<h2><a name=\"Muk\"></a>Tier-1b thin node supercomputer BrENIAC</h2><p>This system is since October 2016 in production use.
</p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>On this cluster you can run highly parallel, large scale computations that rely critically on efficient communication.
</p><h3>Hardware</h3><ul><li>580 computing nodes
	<ul><li>Two 14-core Intel Xeon processors (Broadwell, E5-2680v4)</li><li>128 GiB RAM (435 nodes) or 256 GiB (145 nodes)</li></ul></li><li>EDR InfiniBand interconnect
	<ul><li>High bandwidth (11.75 GB/s per direction, per link)</li><li>Slightly improved latency over FDR</li></ul></li><li>Storage system
	<ul><li>Capacity of 634 TB</li><li>Peak bandwidth of 20 GB/s</li></ul></li></ul><h2></h2><h2>Software<br></h2><p>You will find the standard Linux HPC software stack installed on the Tier-1 cluster. If required, user support will install additional (Linux) software you require, but you are responsible for taking care of the licensing issues (including associated costs).
</p><h3>Access</h3><p>You can get access to this infrastructure by applying for a starting grant, submitting a project proposal that will be evaluated on scientific and technical merits, or by buying compute time.</p><h2><a name=\"GPU\"></a></h2>"
