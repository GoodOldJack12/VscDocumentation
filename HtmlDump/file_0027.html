<p>The VSC does not only rely on the Tier-1 supercomputer to respond to the need for computing capacity. The HPC clusters of the University of Antwerp, VUB, Ghent University and KU Leuven constitute the VSC Tier-2 infrastructure, with a total computing capacity of 416.2 TFlops. Hasselt University invests in the HPC cluster of Leuven. Each cluster has its own specificity and is managed by the university’s dedicated HPC/ICT team. The clusters are interconnected with a 10 Gbps BELNET network, ensuring maximal cross-site access to the different cluster architectures. For instance, a VSC user from Antwerp can easily log in to the infrastructure at Leuven.<br></p><h2>Infrastructure</h2><ul>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua\">The Tier-2 of the University of Antwerp</a> consists of a cluster with 168 nodes, accounting for 3.360 cores (336 processors) and 75 TFlops. Storage capacity is 100 TB. By the spring of 2017 a new cluster will gradually becoming available, containing 152 regular compute nodes and some facilities for visualisation and to test GPU-computing and Xeon Phi computing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-vub\">The Tier-2 of VUB (Hydra)</a> consists of 3 clusters of successive generations of processors with a peak capacity of 75 TFlops (estimated). The total storage capacity is 446 TB. It has a relatively large memory per computing node and is therefore best fit for computing jobs that require a lot of memory per node or per core. This configuration is complemented by a High Troughput Computing (HTC) grid infrastructure.</li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ugent\">The Tier-2 of Ghent University (Stevin)</a> represents a capacity of 226 TFlops (11.328 cores over 568 nodes) and a storage capacity of 1,430 TB. It is composed of several clusters, 1 of which is intended for single-node computing jobs and 4 for multi-node jobs. One cluster has been optimized for memory-intensive computing jobs and BigData problems.</li>
	<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-kul\">The joint KU Leuven/UHasselt Tier-2</a> housed by KU Leuven focuses on small capability computing and tasks requiring a fairly high disk bandwidth. The infrastructure consists of a thin node cluster with 7.616 cores and a total capacity of  230 TFlops. A shared memory system with 14 TB of RAM and 640 cores yields an additional 12 TFlops. A total storage of 280 TB provides the necessary I/O capacity. Furthermore, there are a number of nodes with accellerators (including the GPU/Xeon Phi cluster purchased as an experimental tier-1 setup) and 2 visualization nodes.</li></ul><h2>More information</h2><p>A more detailed description of the complete infrastructure is available in the \"<a href=\"/en/infrastructure/hardware\">Available hardware</a>\" section of the <a href=\"/en/user-portal\">user portal</a>.</p><ul>
