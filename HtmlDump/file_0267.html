<h2>My jobs seem to run, but I don't see any output or errors?</h2><p>Most probably, you exceeded the disk quota for your home directory, i.e., the total file size for your home directory is just too large.  When a job runs, it needs to store temporary output and error files in your home directory. When it fails to do so, the program will crash, and you won't get feedback, since that feedback would be in the error file that can't be written.</p><p>See the FAQs listed below to <a href=\"/cluster-doc/account-management/managing-disk-usage\">check the amount of disk space</a> you are currently using, and for a few hints on <a href=\"/cluster-doc/access-data-transfer/where-store-data\">what data to store where</a>.</p><p>However, your home directory may unexpectedly fill up in two ways:</p><ol>    <li>a running program produces <a href=\"#large_files\">large amounts of output or errors</a>;</li>
    <li>a program crashes and produces a <a href=\"#cores\">core dump</a>.</li>
</ol><p>Note that one job that produces output or a core that is too large for the file system quota will most probably cause all your jobs that are queued to fail.</p><h3><a name=\"large_files\"></a>Large amounts of output or errors</h3><p>To deal with the first issue, simply redirect the standard output of the command to a file that is in your data or scratch directory, or, if you don't need that output anyway, redirect it to /dev/null. A few examples that can be used in your PBS scripts that execute, e.g., my-prog, are given below.</p><p>To send standard output to a file, you can use:</p><pre>my-prog &gt; $VSC_DATA/my-large-output.txt</pre><p>If you want to redirect both standard output and standard error, use:</p><pre>my-prog  &gt; $VSC_DATA/my-large-output.txt \\
2&gt; $VSC_DATA/my-large-error.txt</pre><p>To redirect both standard output and standard error to the same file, use:</p><pre>my-prog &&gt; $VSC_DATA/my-large-output-error.txt</pre><p>If you don't care for the standard output, simply write:</p><pre>my-prog &gt;/dev/null</pre><h3><a name=\"cores\"></a>Core dump</h3><p>When a program crashes, a core file is generated. This can be used to try and analyse the cause of the crash. However, if you don't need cores for post-mortem analysis, simply add:</p><pre>ulimit -c 0</pre><p>to your .bashrc file. This can be done more selectively by adding this line to your PBS script prior to invoking your program.</p>"
