<h2>The application</h2><p>The designated way to get access to the Tier-1 for research purposes is through a project application.</p><p>You have to submit a proposal to get compute time on the Tier-1 cluster BrENIAC.
</p><p>You should include a realistic estimate of the compute time needed in the project in your application. These estimations can best be endorsed by Tier-1 benchmarks. To be able to perform these tests for new codes, you can request a <a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/tier1-starting-grant\">starting grant</a> through a short and quick procedure.
</p><p>You can submit proposals continuously, but they will be gathered, evaluated and resources allocated at a number of cut-off dates. There are 3 cut-off dates in 2018 :
</p><ul>
	<li>February 5, 2018</li>
	<li>June 4, 2018</li>
	<li>October 1, 2018</li>
</ul><p>Proposals submitted since the last cut-off and before each of these dates are reviewed together.
</p><p>The FWO appoints an evaluation commission to do this.
</p><p>Because of the international composition of the <a href=\"/en/about-vsc/organisation-structure#tier1-evaluation\">evaluation commission</a>, the preferred language for the proposals is English. If a proposal is in Dutch, you must also sent an English translation. Please have a look at the documentation of standard terms like: CPU, core, node-hour, memory, storage, and use these consistently in the proposal.
</p><p>You can submit you application <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tier12017\" target=\"_blank\">via EasyChair</a> using the application forms below.<br>
</p><h2>Relevant documents - 2018</h2><p>As was already the case for applications for computing time on the Tier-1 granted in 2016 and 2017 and coming from researchers at universities, the Flemish SOCs and the Flemish public knowledge institutions, applicants do not have to pay a contribution in the cost of compute time and storage. Of course, the applications have to be of outstanding quality. The evaluation commission remains responsible for te review of the applications. For industry the price for compute time is 13 EURO per node day including VAT and for storage 15 EURO per TB per month including VAT.
