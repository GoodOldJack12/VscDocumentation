<h2>Purpose</h2><p>OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran, on most processor architectures and operating systems. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior.
</p>
<p>OpenMP uses a portable, scalable model that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from the standard desktop computer to the supercomputer. T<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">he current version of the OpenMP specification is 4.0. It was released in July 2013 and is probably the biggest update of the specification so far. However, not all compilers already fully support this standard. The previous specification were the OpenMP 3.1 specification (July 2011) and OpenMP 3.0 specification (May 2008). Versions prior to 4.0 concentrated on exploiting thread-level parallelism on multicore machines in a portable way, while version 4.0 of the specifications adds support for vectorisation for the SIMD instruction sets on modern CPUs and offload of computations to accelerators (GPU, Xeon Phi, ...). The latter feature is an alternative to the use of OpenACC directives.</span>
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You should have a program that uses the OpenMP API.
</p>
<h2>Implementations</h2>
<p>On the VSC clusters, the following compilers support OpenMP<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;\">:</span>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-intel#intel-openmp\">Intel compilers</a> in the intel toolchain
	<ol>
		<li>
		The Intel compiler version 13.1 (intel/2014a and intel/2014b toolchains) implement the OpenMP 3.1 specification
		</li>
		<li>
		The Intel compiler version 14.0 (installed on some systems outside the toolchains, sometimes in a package with icc/2013_sp1 in its name) implements the OpenMP 3.1 specification and some elements of the OpenMP 4.0 specification (which was only just approved when the compiler was released)
		</li>
		<li>
		The Intel compiler version 15.0 (intel/2015a  and intel/2015b toolchain) supports all of the OpenMP 4.0 specification except user-defined reductions. It supports offload to a Xeon Phi system (and to some Intel processor-integrated graphics, but that is not relevant on the VSC-clusters).
		</li>
		<li>The Intel compiler version 16.0 (intel/2016a and intel/2016b toolchains) offers almost complete OpenMP 4.0 support. User-defined reductions are now also supported.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-foss#foss-openmp\">GCC</a> in the foss toolchain
	<ol>
		<li>
		GCC versions 4.8.2 (foss/2014a toolchain) and 4.8.3 (foss/2014b toolchain) support the OpenMP 3.1 specification.
		</li>
		<li>
		GCC version 4.9.2 (foss/2015a toolchain) and 4.9.3 (foss/2015b and foss/2016a toolchains) support the full OpenMP 4.0 specification. However, \"offloaded\" code is run on the CPU and not on the GPU or any other accelerator. (In fact, OpenMP 4.0 is supported for C/C++ starting in GCC 4.9.0 and for Fortran in GC 4.9.1).
		</li>
		<li>
		GCC 5.4 (foss/2016b toolchain) offers full OpenMP 4.0 support and has the basics built in to support offloading. </li>
		<li>GCC 6.x (not yet part of a toolchain) offers full OpenMP 4.5 support in C and C++, including offloading to some variants of the Xeon Phi and to AMD HSAIL and some support for OpenACC on NVIDIA.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>When developing your own software, this is the preferred order to select the toolchain. The GCC OpenMP runtime is for most applications inferior to the Intel implementation.
</p>
<p>We also assume you are already familiar with the job submission procedure. If not, check the \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/running-jobs\">Running jobs</a>\" section first.
</p>
<h2>Compiling OpenMP code</h2>
<p>See the instructions on the <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/toolchains\">page about toolchains</a> for compiling OpenMP code with the Intel and GNU compilers.
</p>
<p>Note that it is in fact possible to link OpenMP object code compiled with gcc and the Intel compiler on the condition that the Intel OpenMP libraries and run-time is used (e.g., by linking using icc with the -openmp option), but the Intel manual is not clear which versions of gcc and icc work together well. This is only for specialists but may be useful if you only have access to object files and not to the full source code.
</p>
<h2>Running OpenMP programs</h2>
<p>Since OpenMP is intended for use in a shared memory context, when submitting a job to the queue system, remember to request a single node (i.e., <code>-l nodes=1</code>) and as many processors as you need parallel threads (e.g., <code>-l ppn=4</code>). The latter should not exceed the number of cores on the machine the job runs on. For relevant hardware information, please consult the <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">list of available hardware</a>.
</p>
<p>You may have to set the number of cores that the program should use by hand, e.g., when you don't use all cores on a node, because the mechanisms in the OpenMP runtime that recognize the number of cores, don't recognize the number of cores assigned to the job but the total number of cores. Depending on the program, this may be trough a command line option to the executable, a value in the input file or the environment variable <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code>. Failing to set this value may result in threads competing with each other for resources such as cache and access to the CPU and thus lower performance.
