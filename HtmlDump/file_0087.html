<h2>Software stack</h2><p>Software installation and maintenance on HPC infrastructure such as the VSC clusters poses a number of challenges not encountered on a workstation or a departemental cluster. For many libraries and programs, multiple versions have to installed and maintained as some users require specific versions of those. And those libraries or executable sometimes rely on specific versions of other libraries, further complicating the matter.</p><p>The way Linux finds the right executable for a command, and a program loads the right version of a library or a plug-in, is through so-called environment variables. These can, e.g., be set in your shell configuration files (e.g., <code>.bashrc)</code>, but this requires a certain level of expertise. Moreover, getting those variables right is tricky and requires knowledge of where all files are on the cluster. Having to manage all this by hand is clearly not an option.
</p><p>We deal with this on the VSC clusters in the following way. First, we've defined the concept of a <a href=\"/cluster-doc/development/toolchains\">toolchain</a> on most of the newer clusters. They consist of a set of compilers, MPI library and basic libraries that work together well with each other, and then a number of applications and other libraries compiled with that set of tools and thus often dependent on those. We use tool chains based on the Intel and GNU compilers, and refresh them twice a year, leading to version numbers like 2014a, 2014b or 2015a for the first and second refresh of a given year. Some tools are installed outside a toolchain, e.g., additional versions requested by a small group of users for specific experiments, or tools that only depend on basic system libraries. Second, we use the module system to manage the environment variables and all dependencies and possible conflicts between various programs and libraries., and that is what this page focuses on.
</p><p><em>Note: Since August 2016, a <a href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod\">different implementation of the module system has been implemented on the UGent and VUB Tier-2 systems</a>, called Lmod. Though highly compatible with the system used on the other clusters, it offers <a href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod#commands\">a lot of new commands</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/cluster-doc/software/modules-lmod#Advantages-differences\">some key differences</a>. Most of the commands below will still work though.</em></p><h2>Basic use of the module system</h2><p>Many software packages are installed as modules. These packages include compilers, interpreters, mathematical software such as Matlab and SAS, as well as other applications and libraries. This is managed with the <code>module</code> command.
</p><p>To view a list of available software packages, use the command <code>module av</code>. The output will look similar to this:
</p><pre>$ module av
----- /apps/leuven/thinking/2014a/modules/all ------
Autoconf/2.69-GCC-4.8.2
Autoconf/2.69-intel-2014a
Automake/1.14-GCC-4.8.2
Automake/1.14-intel-2014a
BEAST/2.1.2
...
pyTables/2.4.0-intel-2014a-Python-2.7.6
timedrun/1.0.1
worker/1.4.2-foss-2014a
zlib/1.2.8-foss-2014a
zlib/1.2.8-intel-2014a
</pre><p>This gives a list of software packages that can be loaded. Some packages in this list include <code>intel-2014a</code> or <code>foss-2014a</code> in their name. These are packages installed with the 2014a versions of the toolchains based on the Intel and GNU compilers respectively. The other packages do not belong to a particular toolchain. The name of the packages also includes a version number (right after the /) and sometimes other packages they need.
</p><p>Often, when looking for some specific software, you will want to filter the list of available modules, since it tends to be rather large. The module command writes its output to standard error, rather than standard output, which is somewhat confusing when using pipes to filter. The following command would show only the modules that have the string 'python' in their name, regardless of the case.</p><pre>$ module av |& grep -i python
</pre><p>A module is loaded using the command <code>module load</code> with the name of the package. E.g., with the above list of modules,
</p><pre>$ module load BEAST
</pre><p>will load the <code>BEAST/2.1.2</code> package.
</p><p>For some packages, e.g., <code>zlib</code> in the above list, multiple versions are installed; the <code>module load</code> command will automatically choose the lexicographically last, which is typically, but not always, the most recent version. In the above example,
</p><pre> $ module load zlib
</pre><p>will load the module <code>zlib/1.2.8-intel-2014a</code>. This may not be the module that you want if you're using the GNU compilers. In that case, the user should specify a particular version, e.g.,
</p><pre>$ module load zlib/1.2.8-foss-2014a
</pre><p>Obviously, the user needs to keep track of the modules that are currently loaded. After executing the above two load commands, the list of loaded modules will be very similar to:
</p><pre>$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) /thinking/2014a
  2) Java/1.7.0_51
  3) icc/2013.5.192
  4) ifort/2013.5.192
  5) impi/4.1.3.045
  6) imkl/11.1.1.106
  7) intel/2014a
  8) beagle-lib/20140304-intel-2014a
  9) BEAST/2.1.2
 10) GCC/4.8.2
 11) OpenMPI/1.6.5-GCC-4.8.2

 14) FFTW/3.3.3-gompi-2014a
 15) ScaLAPACK/2.0.2-gompi-2014a-OpenBLAS-0.2.8-LAPACK-3.5.0
 16) foss/2014a
 17) zlib/1.2.8-foss-2014a
</pre><p>It is important to note at this point that, e.g., <code>icc/2013.5.192</code> is also listed, although it was not loaded explicitly by the user. This is because <code>BEAST/2.1.2</code> depends on it, and the system administrator specified that the <code>intel</code> toolchain module that contains this compiler should be loaded whenever the <code>BEAST</code> module is loaded. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, so be aware of automatically loaded modules whenever things go wrong: they may have something to do with it!
</p><p>To unload a module, one can use the <code>module unload</code> command. It works consistently with the <code>load</code> command, and reverses the latter's effect. One can however unload automatically loaded modules manually, to debug some problem.
</p><pre>$ module unload BEAST
</pre><p>Notice that the version was not specified: the module system is sufficiently clever to figure out what the user intends. However, checking the list of currently loaded modules is always a good idea, just to make sure...
</p><p>In order to unload all modules at once, and hence be sure to start with a clean slate, use:
</p><pre>$ module purge
</pre><p>It is a good habit to use this command in PBS scripts, prior to loading the modules specifically needed by applications in that job script. This ensures that no version conflicts occur if the user loads module using his <code>.bashrc</code> file.
</p><p>Finally, modules need not be loaded one by one; the two 'load' commands can be combined as follows:
</p><pre>$ module load  BEAST/2.1.2  zlib/1.2.8-foss-2014a
</pre><p>This will load the two modules and, automatically, the respective toolchains with just one command.
</p><p>To get a list of all available module commands, type:
</p><pre>$ module help
</pre><h2><a name=\"getting-more-software\"></a>Getting even more software</h2><p>The list of software available on a particular cluster can be unwieldingly long and the information that <code>module av</code> produces overwhelming. Therefore the administrators may have chose to only show the most relevant packages by default, and not show, e.g., packages that aim at a different cluster, a particular node type or a less complete toolchain. Those additional packages can then be enabled by loading another module first. E.g., on hopper, the most recent UAntwerpen cluster when we wrote this text, the most complete and most used toolchains were the 2014a versions. Hence only the list of packages in those releases of the <code>intel</code> and <code>foss</code> (GNU) toolchain were shown at the time. Yet
</p><pre>$ module av
</pre><p>returns at the end of the list:
</p><pre>...

hopper/all   hopper/sl6   perfexpert   turing
</pre><p>The packages such as <code>hopper/2014b</code> enable additional packages when loaded.
</p><p>Similarly, on ThinKing, the KU Leuven cluster:
</p><pre>$ module av
...

ictstest/2014a  K20Xm/2015a     K40c/2015a      phi/2014a       thinking2/2014a
</pre><p>shows modules specifically for the thin node cluster ThinKing, the <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-kul#Cerebro\">SGI shared memory system Cerebro</a>, three types of NVIDIA GPU nodes and the Xeon Phi nodes. Loading one of these will show the appropriate packages in the list obtained with <code>module av</code>. E.g.,
</p><pre>module load cerebro/2014a
</pre><p>will make some additional modules available for Cerebro, including two additional toolchains with the SGI MPI libraries to take full advantage of the interconnect of that machine.
</p><h2>Explicit version numbers</h2><p>As a rule, once a module has been installed on the cluster, the executables or libraries it comprises are never modified. This policy ensures that the user's programs will run consistently, at least if the user specifies a specific version. Failing to specify a version may result in unexpected behavior.
</p><p>Consider the following example: the user decides to use the GSL library for numerical computations, and at that point in time, just a single version 1.15, compiled with the foss toolchain is installed on the cluster. The user loads the library using:
</p><pre>$ module load GSL
</pre><p>rather than
</p><pre>$ module load GSL/1.15-foss-2014a
</pre><p>Everything works fine, up to the point where a new version of GSL is installed, e.g., 1.16 compiled with both the <code>intel</code> and the <code>foss</code> toolchain. From then on, the user's load command will load the latter version, rather than the one he intended, which may lead to unexpected problems.
