<p>All the VSC clusters run the Linux operating system:</p><ul>
	<li>KU Leuven: Red Hat Enterprise Linux ComputeNode release 6.5 (Santiago), 64 bit</li>
	<li>UAntwerpen: CentOS 7.x</li>
	<li>UGent: Scientific Linux</li>
</ul><p>This means that, when you connect to one of them, you get a command line interface, which looks something like this:
</p><pre>vsc30001@login1:~&gt;
</pre><p>When you see this, we also say you are inside a \"shell\".   The shell will accept your commands, and execute them.
</p><p>Some of the most often used commands include:
</p><table class=\"prettytable\">
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>ls
	</td>
	<td>Shows you a list of files in the current directory
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>cd
	</td>
	<td>Change current working directory
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>rm
	</td>
	<td>Remove file or directory
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>joe
	</td>
	<td>Text editor
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>echo
	</td>
	<td>Prints its parameters to the screen
	</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Most commands will accept or even need parameters, which are placed after the command, seperated by spaces. A simple example with the 'echo' command:
</p><pre>$ echo This is a test
This is a test
</pre><p>Important here is the \"$\" sign in front of the first line. This should not be typed, but is a convention meaning \"the rest of this line should be typed at your shell prompt\". The lines not starting with the \"$\" sign are usually the feedback or output from the command.
</p><p>More commands will be used in the rest of this text, and will be explained then if necessary. If not, you can usually get more information about a command, say the item or command 'ls', by trying either of the following:
</p><pre>$ ls --help
$ man ls
$ info ls
</pre><p>(You can exit the last two \"manuals\" by using the 'q' key.)
