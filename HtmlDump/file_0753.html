<h2>Important changes</h2><p>The 2017a toolchain is the toolchain thatwill be carried forward to Leibniz and will be available after the operating
system upgrade of Hopper. Hence it is meant to be as complete as possible. We
will only make a limited number of programs available in the 2016b toolchain
(basically those that show much better performance with the older compiler or
that do not compile with the compilers in the 2017a toolchains).
</p><p>Important changes
in the 2017a toolchain:
</p><ul>
	<li>The Intel compilers have been installed in
a single directory tree, much the way Intel intends the install to be done. The
intel/2017a module loads fewer submodules and instead sets all required
variables. The install now also contains the Thread Building Blocks (TBB),
Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) and Data Analytics Acceleration Library
(DAAL). All developer tools (debugger, Inspector, Advisor, Vtune
Amplifier, ITAC) are enabled by loading the inteldevtools/2017a module rather
than independent modules for each tool. More information is available on 
	<a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua/intel\">the documentation page on the Intel compilers @ UAntwerp</a>.</li>
	<li>The Python install now also contains a
number of packages that previously where accessed via separate modules:
	<ul>
		<li>matplotlib, so there is no longer a
separate module to load matplotlib. 
		</li>
		<li>lxml</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The R install now also contains a selection
of the Bioconductor routines, so no separate module is needed to enable the
latter.
	</li>
	<li>netCDF is now a single module containing
all 4 interfaces rather than 4 separate modules that installed each interface
in a different directory tree (three of which all relied on the module for the
fourth). This should ease the installation of code that uses the netCDF Fortran
or one of the C++ interfaces and expects all netCDF libraries to be installed
in the same directory.
	</li>
</ul><p>We will skip the 2017b toolchain as defined by the VSC as we have already upgraded the 2017a toolchain to a more recent update of the Intel 2017 compilers to avoid problems with certain applications.
</p><h2>Available toolchains</h2><p>There are
currently three major toolchains on the UAntwerp clusters:
</p><ul>
	<li>The Intel toolchain,
which includes the Intel compilers and tools, matching versions of the GNU
compilers, and all software compiled with them.
	<ul>
		<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua/toolchain-2017a-intel\">Modules in the intel/2017a toolchain</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The FOSS toolchain,
built out of open-source components. It is mostly used for programs that don’t
install with the Intel compilers, or by users who want to do development with
Open MPI and other open-source libraries.
	<br>
	The FOSS-toolchain has a number of subtoolchains: Gompi, GCC and GCCcore, and
some programs are installed in these subtoolchains because they don’t use the
additional components that FOSS offers.
	<ul>
		<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua/toolchain-2017a-foss\">Modules in the foss/2017a toolchain and its subtoolchains</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The system toolchain
(sl6 or centos7), containing programs that only use system libraries or other
tools from this toolchain.
	<ul>
		<li><a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua/toolchain-system-centos7\">Modules in the system toolchain for CentOS 7</a></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>The tables below
list the last available module for a given software package and the
corresponding version in the 2017a toolchain. Older versions can only be
installed on demand with a very good motivation, as older versions of packages
also often fail to take advantage of advances in supercomputer architecture and
offer lower performance. Packages that have not been used recently will
only be installed on demand.
</p><p>Several of the
packages in the system toolchain are still listed as “on demand” since they
require licenses and interaction with their users is needed before we can
install them.
