<h2>Why use a version control system?</h2><p>A version control systems (VCS) help you manage the changes to the source files of your project, and most systems also support team development. Since it remembers the history of your files, you can always return to an earlier version if you've screwed up making changes. By adding comments when you store a new version in the VCS it also becomes much easier to track which change was made for what purpose at what time. And if you develop in a team, it helps to organise making coordinated changes to the code base, and it supports co-development even across file system borders (e.g., when working with a remote partner).</p><p>Most Integrated Development Environments (IDE) offer support for one or more version control systems. E.g., Eclipse, the IDE which we recommend for the development of C/C++ or Fortran codes on clusters, supports all of the systems mentioned on this page, some out-of-the-box and others by adding an additional package. The systems mentioned on this page are all available on Linux, OS X and Windows (through the UNIX emulation layer cygwin and all except RCS also in at least one native implementation).
</p><h2>Types of version control systems</h2><p>An excellent introduction to the various types of version control systems can be found in <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2\" target=\"_blank\">the book Pro GIT by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub</a>.
</p><h3>Local systems</h3><p>These first generation systems use a local database that stores previous versions of files. One of the most popular examples of this type is the venerable RCS (Revision Control System) system, distributed with many UNIX-like systems. It works by keeping patch sets (differences between various versions of a file) in a special format on disk. It can then return to a previous version of a file by adding up all the patches.
</p><p>RCS and other \"local systems\"  are very outdated. Hence we advise you to use one of the systems from the next two categories.

	</li>
</ul><h3>Centralised systems</h3><p>Centralised version control systems were developed to enable people to collaborate on code and documents with people on different systems that may not share a common file system. The version files are now maintained by a server to which multiple clients can connect and check out files, and the systems help to manage concurrent changes to a file by several users (through a copy-modify-merge procedure). Popular examples of this type are CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and SVN (Subversion). Of those two, SVN is the more recent system while CVS is no longer further developed and less and less used.

	CVS implementations
	<ul>
		<li>
		A command-line client is included in most Linux distributions. On Windows, the cygwin UNIX emulation layer also has a svn package. On OS X, it is available (though no longer maintained) through the MacPorts project.
		</li>
		<li>
		The eclipse IDE comes with built-in support for CVS.

		<a href=\"/client/windows/tortoisesvn\">TortoiseSVN</a> (or <a href=\"https://tortoisesvn.net/\" target=\"_blank\">go straight to the TortoiseSVN web site</a>) is a popular Windows native GUI client that integrates well with the explorer. However, if you google on \" SVN GUI\"  you'll find a plethora of other choices, not only for Windows but also for macOS and Linux
		</li>
		<li>
		SVN can be integrated with the eclipse IDE through the ¨Subversive SVN team provider¨ plugin which can be installed through the \"Install New Software\"  panel in the help menu. More information and instructions are available on the <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/\" target=\"_blank\">subversive subsite of the main eclipse web site</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul><h3>Distributed systems</h3><p>The weak point of the centralised systems is that they require you to be online to checkout a file or to commit a revision. In a distributed system, the clients mirror the complete repository and not just the latest version of each file. When online, the user can then synchronise the local repository with the copy on a server. In a single-user scenario you can still keep all your files in the local repository without using a server, and hence it doesn't make sense anymore to still use one of old local-only version control systems. The disadvantage of a distributed system is that you are not forced to synchronise after every commit, so that the local repositories of various users on a project can be very much out-of-sync with each other, making the job harder when those versions have to be merged again.
</p><p>Popular examples of systems of this type are Git (originally developed to manage the Linux kernel project) and Mercurial (sometimes abbreviated as Hg, chemists will understand why).

	Git implementations
	<ul>
		<li>
		If you have a Linux system, Git is most likely already installed on your system. On OS X, git is available through Xcode, though it is not always the most recent version. On Windows, there is a Git-package in the UNIX emulation layer Cygwin. Downloads for all systems are also available on <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/download\" target=\"_blank\">the download section of the main git web site</a>. That page also contains links to a number of GUI options. Most if not all GUI tools store projects in a way that is fully compatible with the command line tools, so you can use both simultaneously.
        The command line client is also available on the VSC clusters.
		</li>
		<li>
		<a href=\"https://tortoisegit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TortoiseGit</a> is an explorer-integrated interface to Git on Windows similar to TortoiseSVN.
		</li>
		<li>
		Another nice GUI application is <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree\" target=\"_blank\">SourceTree</a> produced by <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlassian</a>. Atlassian is the company behind the Bitbucket cloud service, but their tool also works well with GitHub, one of their main competitors. It has a very nice way of representing the history of a local repository.
		</li>
		<li>
		The Eclipse IDE comes with built-in support for Git through the standard plug-in EGit. More recent versions of this plugin may be available through the <a href=\"https://marketplace.eclipse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse Marketplace</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
		<a href=\"https://www.collab.net/products/giteye\" target=\"_blank\">CollabNet GitEye</a> is a Git GUI for Windows, OS X and Linux build on top of a number of Eclipse libraries, but you don/t need to install Eclipse to be able to use it. It is a nice way though to browse through your Git repositories outside of the Eclipse environment. GitEye itself is free and integrates with several git cloud services and bugtracking services.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Mercurial (Hg) implementations
	<ul>
		<li>
		Mercurial is written in Python and hence runs on most systems. Most Linux distributions offer a mercurial package. <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows and OS X command line utilities are also available</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
		<a href=\"https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/\" target=\"_blank\">TortoiseHg</a> is an explorer-integrated interface to the Mercurial VCS on Windows similar to TortoiseSVN. There is also an OS X and Linux version available. The latter integrates with Gnome/Nautilus.
		</li>
		<li>
		The eclipse IDE supports Mercurial through the <a href=\"https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/mercurialeclipse\" target=\"_blank\">optional MercurialEclipse plugin</a> available on the <a href=\"https://marketplace.eclipse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse Marketplace</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul><h2>Cloud services</h2><p>Many companies offer hosting services for SVN, Git or Mercurial repositories in the cloud. Google, e.g., for <a href=\"https://www.google.be/webhp?#q=subversion+hosting+service\" target=\"_blank\">subversion hosting service</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.be/search?q=git+hosting+service\" target=\"_blank\">git hosting service</a> or <a href=\"https://www.google.be/search?q=mercurial+hosting+service\" target=\"_blank\">mercurial hosting service</a>. Several offer free public hosting for Open Source projects or have free access for academic accounts. Some noteworthy ones that are popular for academic projects are:
</p><ul>
	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Github (github.com)</a> offers free Git and Subversion hosting for Open Source projects. We use this service for some VSC in-house tools development. It is also possible to host private projects if you subscribe to one of their paying plans.</li>
	<li>
	<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitbucket (bitbucket.org)</a> offers both git and mercurial services. It also supports private projects with a limited number of users in free accounts (and has a special deal for academic institutions, allowing unlimited users) while the other services mentioned on this page only support open source projects for free.
	</li>
	<li><a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">SourceForge</a> is a very well known service for hosting Open Source projects. It currently supports projects managed through Subversion, Git, Mercurial and a few other systems.</li>
</ul><p>However, we urge you to always carefully check the terms-of-use of these services to assure that, e.g., the way they deal with intellectual property is in line with your institute's requirements.
</p><h2>Which one should I use?</h2><p>It is not up to us to make this choice for you, but here are a number of elements that you should take into account:
</p><ul>
	<li>
	Subversion, Git and Mercurial are all recent systems that are well maintained and supported by several hosting services.
	</li>
	<li>
	Subversion and Git are installed on most VSC systems. We use Git ourselves for some of our in-house development.
	</li>
	<li>
	Centralised version management systems have a simpler concept than the distributed ones, but if you expect prolonged periods that you are offline, you have to keep in mind that you cannot make any commits during that period.
	</li>
	<li>
	As you have only a single copy of the repository in a centralised system, a reliable hosting service or a good backup strategy is important. In a distributed system it would still be possible to reconstruct the contents of a repository from the other repositories.
	</li>
	<li>
	If you want to use an IDE, it is good to check which systems are supported by the IDE. E.g., Eclipse supports Git out-of-the-box, and Subversion and Mercurial though a plug-in. Visual Studio also supports all three of these systems.
	</li>
