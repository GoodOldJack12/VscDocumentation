<p>There are two possibilities</p><ol>
	<li>
	You can copy your private key from the machine where you generated the key to the other computers you want to use to access the VSC clusters.
    If you want to use both PuTTY on Windows and the tradinional OpenSSH client on OS X or Linux (or Windows with Cygwin) and chose for this scenario, you should generate the key using PuTTY and then export it in OpenSSH format as explained on 
	<a href=\"/client/windows/keys-putty\">the PuTTY pages</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Alternatively, you can generate another keypair for the second machine following the instructions for your respective client (<a href=\"/client/windows/keys-putty\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"/client/macosx/keys-openssh\">macOS/OS X</a>, <a href=\"/client/linux/keys-openssh\">Linux</a>) and then upload the new public key to your account:
	<ol>
		<li>Go to <a href=\"https://account.vscentrum.be/\">the account management web site account.vscentrum.be</a></li>
		<li>Choose \"Edit account\"</li>
		<li>And then add the public key via that page. It can take half an hour before you can use the key.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol><p>We prefer the second scenario, in particular if you want to access the clusters from a laptop or tablet, as these are easily stolen. In this way, all you need to do if your computer is stolen or your key may be compromised in another way, is to delete that key on the account website (via \"Edit account\"). You can continue to work on your other devices.
