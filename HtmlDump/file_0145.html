<h2>The VSC account</h2><p>In order to use the infrastructure of the VSC, you need a VSC-userid, also called a VSC account. The only exception are users of the VUB who just want to use the VUB Tier-2 infrastructure. For them their VUB userid is sufficient. You can then use the same userid on all VSC infrastructure to which you have access.</p><p>Your account also includes two “blocks” of disk space: your home directory and data directory. Both are accessible from all VSC clusters. When you log in to a particular cluster, you will also be assigned one or more blocks of temporary disk space, called scratch directories. Which directory should be used for which type of data, is explained in the <a href=\"/en/user-portal\">user documentation</a>.
</p><p>You do not automatically have access to all VSC clusters with your VSC account. For the main Tier-1 compute cluster you need to submit a project application (or you should be covered by a project application within your research group). For some more specialised hardware you have to ask access separately, typically to the coordinator of your institution, because we want to be sure that that (usually rather expensive hardware) is used efficiently for the type of applications for which it was purchased. Also, you do not simply get automatic access to all available software. You can use all free software and a number of compilers and other development tools, but for most commercial software, you must first prove that you have a valid license (or the person who has paid the license on the cluster must allow you to use the license). For this you can contact your local support team.
</p><p>Before you can apply for your account, you will usually have to install an extra piece of software on your computer, called a ssh client. How the actual account application should be made and where you can find the software, is explained in the user documentation on the user portal.
</p><h2>Who can get access?</h2><ul>
	<li>All researchers at the Flemish university associations can get a VSC account. In many cases, this is done through a fully automated application process, but in some cases you must submit a request to your local support team. Specific details about these procedures can be found on the \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/account-request\">Account request</a>\" page in the user documentation.</li>
	<li>Also Master students can get access to the Tier-2 infrastructure in the framework of their master thesis if supercomputing is needed for the thesis. For this, you will first need the approval of your supervisor. The details about the procedure can again be found on the \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/account-request\">Account request</a>\" page in the user documentation.</li>
	<li>At the University of Leuven and Hasselt University lecturers can also use the local Tier-2 infrastructure in the context of some courses (when the software cannot run in the PC classes or the computers in those classes are not powerful enough). Again, you can find all the details about the application process on the \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/account-request\">Account request</a>\" page in the user documentation. It is important that the application is submitted on time, at least two weeks before the start of the computer sessions.</li>
	<li>Researchers from minds and VIB can also get access. The application is made through your host university. The same applies to researchers at the university hospitals and research institutes under the direction or supervision of a university or a university college, such as the special university institutes mentioned in Article 169quater of the Decree of 12 June 1991 concerning universities in the Flemish Community.</li>
	<li>Researchers at other Flemish public research institutions can compute on the Tier-1 infrastructure through a project application or can contact one of the coordinators of the university associations to access Tier-2 infrastructure. For larger amounts of computing time a fair financial compensation may be asked because universities also co-finance the operation of the VSC from their own.</li>
	<li>Businesses, non-Flemish public knowledge institutions and not-for-profit organisations can also gain access to the infrastructure. The procedures are explained on the page \"<a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/access-industry\">Access for industry</a>\".</li>
</ul><h2>Additional information</h2><p>Before you apply for VSC account, it is useful to first check whether the infrastructure is suitable for your application. Windows or OS X programs for instance cannot run on our infrastructure as we use the Linux operating system on the clusters. The infrastructure also should not be used to run applications for which the compute power of a good laptop is sufficient. The pages on the <a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/tier-1-clusters\">Tier-1</a> and <a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/tier-2-clusters\">Tier-2 infrastructure</a> in this part of the website give a high-level description of our infrastructure. You can find more detailed information in the user documentation on the user portal. When in doubt, you can also contact your local support team. This does not require a VSC account.
</p><p>Furthermore, you should first check the page \"<a href=\"/cluster-doc/account-request\">Account request</a>\" in the <a href=\"/en/user-portal\">user documentation</a> and install the necessary software on your PC. You can also find links to information about that software on the “Account Request” page.
</p><p>Furthermore, it can also be useful to take one of the introductory courses that we organise periodically at all universities. However, it is best to apply for your VSC account before the course since you also can then also do the exercises during the course. We strongly urge people who are not familiar with the use of a Linux supercomputer to take such a course. After all, we do not have enough staff to help everyone individually for all those generic issues.
