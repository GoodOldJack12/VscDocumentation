<p>This section is still rather empty. It will be expanded over time.</p><h2>Visualization software</h2><ul>
	<li><a href=\"https://www.paraview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ParaView</a> is a free visualization package. It can be used in three modes:
	<ul>
		<li>Installed on your desktop: you have to transfer your data to your desktop system</li>
		<li>As an interactive process on the cluster: this option is available only for <a href=\"/client/multiplatform/nx-start-guide\">NoMachine NX users</a> (go to the Applications menu -&gt; HPC -&gt; Visualisation -&gt; Paraview).</li>
		<li>In client-server mode: The interactive part of ParaView is running on your desktop, while the server part that reads the data and renders the images (no GPU required as ParaView also contains a software OpenGL renderer) and sends the rendered images to the client on the desktop. Setting up ParaView for this scenario is explained in the <a href=\"/cluster-doc/postprocessing/paraview-remote-visualization\">page on ParaView remote visualization</a>.</li>
	</ul>
