<h2>Prerequisite: PuTTY and WinSCP</h2><p>You've <a href=\"/client/windows/keys-putty\">generated a public/private key pair with PuTTY</a> and have an approved account on the VSC clusters.</p><h2>Connecting to the VSC clusters</h2><p>When you start the PuTTY executable 'putty.exe', a configuration screen pops up.  Follow the steps below to setup the connection to (one of) the VSC clusters.
</p><p>In the screenshots, we show the setup for user vsc98765 to the ThinKing cluster at K.U.Leuven via the loginnode login.hpc.kuleuven.be.
</p><p>You can find the names and ip-addresses of the loginnodes in the sections of <a href=\"/infrastructure/hardware\">the local VSC clusters</a>.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can follow a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vscentrum.be/assets/1191\">short video</a>
 explaining step-by-step the process of making connection to VSC login nodes (example based on KU Leuven cluster).<br></p><ol>
	<li>
	Within the category Session, in the field 'Host Name', type in &lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;, which is the name of the loginnode of the VSC cluster you want to connect to.<br>

	<li>In the category Connection &gt; Data, in the field 'Auto-login username', put in &lt;vsc-account&gt;, which is your VSC username that you have received by mail after your request was approved.</li>
	<li>
	In the category Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Auth, click on 'Browse' and select the private key that you generated and saved above.<br>
	<img src=\"/assets/129\" alt=\"PuTTY SSH Auth\"><br>
	Here, the private key was previously saved in the folder C:\\Documents and Settings\\Me\\Keys.  In newer versions of Windows, \"C:\\Users\" is used instead \"C:\\Documents and Settings\".
	</li>
	<li>
	In the category Connection &gt; SSH &gt; X11, click the Enable X11 Forwarding checkbox:<br>

	<li>Now go back to Session, and fill in a name in the 'Saved Sessions' field and press 'Save' to store the session information.</li>
	<li>Now pressing 'Open' should start ask for you passphrase, and connect you to &lt;vsc-loginnode&gt;.</li>
</ol><p>The first time you make a connection to the loginnode, a Security Alert will appear and you will be asked to verify the authenticity of the loginnode.
</p><p><img src=\"/assets/133\" alt=\"PuTTY Security Alert\">
</p><p>For future sessions, just select your saved session from the list and press 'Open'.
