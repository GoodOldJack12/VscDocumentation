<h2>The application</h2><p>The designated way to get access to the Tier-1 for research purposes is through a project application.</p><p>You have to submit a proposal to get compute time on the Tier-1 cluster Muk.
</p><p>You should include a realistic estimate of the compute time needed in the project in your application. These estimations can best be endorsed by Tier-1 benchmarks. To be able to perform these tests for new codes, you can request a <a href=\"/en/access-and-infrastructure/tier1-starting-grant\">starting grant</a> through a short and quick procedure.
</p><p>You can submit proposals continuously, but they will be gathered, evaluated and resources allocated at a number of cut-off dates. There are 3 cut-off dates in 2016 :
</p><ul>
	<li>February 1, 2016</li>
	<li>June 6, 2016</li>
	<li>October 3, 2016</li>
</ul><p>Proposals submitted since the last cut-off and before each of these dates are reviewed together.
</p><p>The FWO appoints an evaluation commission to do this.
</p><p>Because of the international composition of the <a href=\"/en/about-vsc/organisation-structure#tier1-evaluation\">evaluation commission</a>, the preferred language for the proposals is English. If a proposal is in Dutch, you must also sent an English translation. Please have a look at the documentation of standard terms like: CPU, core, node-hour, memory, storage, and use these consistently in the proposal.
</p><p>For applications in 2014 or 2015, costs for resources used will be invoiced, with various discounts for Flemish-funded academic researchers. You should be aware that the investments and operational costs for the Tier-1 infrastructure are considerable.
</p><p>You can submit you application <a href=\"#easychair\">via EasyChair</a> using the application forms below.
</p><h2>Relevant documents - 2016</h2><p>On October 26 the Board of Directors of the Hercules foundation decided to make a major adjustment to the regulations regarding applications to use the Flemish supercomputer.
</p><p>For applications for computing time on the Tier-1 granted in 2016 and coming from researchers at universities, the Flemish SOCs and the Flemish public knowledge institutions, applicants will no longer have to pay a contribution in the cost of compute time and storage. Of course, the applications have to be of outstanding quality. The evaluation commission remains responsible for te review of the applications.
</p><p>For applications granted in 2015 the current pricing structure remains in place and contributions will be asked.
</p><p>The adjusted Regulations for 2016 can be found in the links below.
</p><p>From January 1, 2016 on the responsibility for the funding of HPC and the management of the Tier-1 has been transferred to the FWO, including all current decisions and ongoing contracts.

</table><p>(*) The price for one nodeday is 13.54 euro (incl. overhead and support of Tier-1 technical support team, but excl. advanced support by specialized staff). The price for 1TB storage per month is 46.80 euro (incl. overhead and support of TIER1 technical support team, but excl. advanced support by specialized staff). Approved Tier-1 projects get a default quota of 1TB. Only storage request higher then 1TB will be charged for the amount above 1TB.
