Patrick Bultinck. <em>In silico</em> Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry and Supercomputers</span></h2> <p><em>Universiteit Gent/Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry</em></p> <p>Quantum Chemistry deals with the chemical application of quantum mechanics to understand the nature of chemical substances, the reasons for their (in)stability but also with finding ways to predict properties of novel molecules prior to their synthesis. The working horse of quantum chemists is therefore no longer the laboratory but the supercomputer. The reason for this is that quantum chemical calculations are notoriously computationally demanding.<br> These computational demands are illustrated by the scaling of computational demands with respect to the size of molecules and the level of theory applied. An example from Vibrational Circular Dichroism calculations shows how supercomputers play a role in stimulating innovation in chemistry.</p> <p><strong>Prof. dr. Patrick Bultinck</strong> (° Blankenberge, 1971) is professor in Quantum Chemistry, Computational and inorganic chemistry at Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry. He is author of roughly 100 scientific publications and performs research in quantum chemistry with emphasis on the study of concepts such as the chemical bond, the atom in the molecule and aromaticity. Another main topic is the use of computational (quantum) chemistry in drug discovery. In 2002 and 2003 P. Bultinck received grants from the European Center for SuperComputing in Catalunya for his computationally demanding work in this field.</p> <h2><a name=\"Vanroose\"></a><span style=\"font-size: medium;\" rel=\"font-size: medium;\">Prof. dr.

Grid applications in particle and astroparticle physics: The CMS and IceCube projects</span></h2> <p><em>Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Faculty of Science and Bio-engineering Sciences, Department of Physics, Research Group of Elementary Particle Physics</em></p> <p>The large hadron collider LHC at the international research centre CERN near Geneva is due to go into operation at the end of 2009. It will be the most powerful particle accelerator ever, and will give us a first glimpse of the new phenomena that that are expected to occur at these energies. However, the analysis of the data produced by the experiments around this accelerator also represents an unprecedented challenge. The VUB, UGent and UA  participate in the CMS project. This is one of the four major experiments to be performed at this accelerator. One year of CMS operation will result in about 106 GBytes of data. To cope with this flow of data, the CMS collaboration has setup a GRID computing infrastructure with distributed computer infrastructure scattered over the participating laboratories in 4 continents.<br> The IceCube Neutrino Detector is a neutrino observatory currently under construction at the South Pole. IceCube is being constructed in deep Antarctic ice by deploying thousands of optical sensors at depths between 1,450 and 2,450 meters. The main goal of the experiment is to detect very high energy neutrinos from the cosmos. The neutrinos are not detected themselves. Instead, the rare instance of a collision between a neutrino and an atom within the ice is used to deduce the kinematical parameters of the incoming neutrino. The sources of those neutrinos could be black holes, gamma ray bursts, or supernova remnants. The data that IceCube will collect will also contribute to our understanding of cosmic rays, supersymmetry, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS), and other aspects of nuclear and particle physics. The analysis of the data produced by ice cube requires similar computing facilities as the analysis of the LHC data.</p> <p><strong>Prof. dr.

Optimal solutions for common problems are usually computationally infeasible even with the biggest HPC installations, therefore researchers develop heuristics or use techniques such as genetic algorithms to come close to optimal solutions. One of the nice properties they possess is that they are typically easily parallelizable. In this talk, I will give several examples of typical research questions, which need an HPC infrastructure to obtain good solutions in a reasonable time window. These include the optimization of marketing actions towards different marketing segments in the domain of analytical CRM (customer relationship management) and solving multiple-TSP (traveling salesman problem) under load balancing, alternatively known as the vehicle routing problem under load balancing.</p> <p><strong>Prof. dr. Dirk Van den Poel</strong> (° Merksem, 1969) is professor of marketing modeling/analytical customer relationship management (aCRM) at Ghent University.

Supercomputing and Linguistics</span></h2> <p><em>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,  Faculty of Arts, Research Unit Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics (QLVL)</em></p> <p>Communicating through language is arguably one of the most complex processes that the most powerful computer we know, the human brain,  is capable of.  As a science, Linguistics aims to uncover the intricate system of patterns and structures that make up human language and that allow us to convey meaning through words and sentences. Although linguists have been investigating and describing these structures for ages, it is only recently that large amounts of electronic data and the computational power to analyse them have become available and have turned linguistics into a truly data-driven science. The primary data for linguistic research is ordinary, everyday language use like conversations or texts. These are collected in very large electronic text collections, containing millions of words and these collections are then mined for meaningful structures and patterns.  With increasing amounts of data and ever more advanced statistical algorithms,  these analyses are not longer feasible on individual servers but require the computational power of interconnected super computers. <br> In the presentation, I  will briefly describe two case studies of computationally heavy linguistic research.  A first case study has to do with the pre-processing of linguistic data. In order to find patterns at different levels of abstraction, each word in the text collection has to be enriched with information about its word class (noun, adjective, verb,..) and  syntactic function within the sentence (subject, direct object, indirect object...). A piece of software, called a parser, can add this information automatically.  For our research, we wanted to parse a text collection of 1.3 billion words, i.e. all issues from a 7 year period of 6 Flemish daily newspapers, representing a staggering 13 years of computing on an ordinary computer. Thanks to the K.U.Leuven's supercomputer, this could be done in just a few months. This data has now been made available to the wider research community.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Kris Heylen</strong> obtained a Master in Germanic Linguistics (2000) and a Master in Artificial Intelligence (2001) from the K.U.Leuven. In 2005, he was awarded a PhD in Linguistics at the K.U.leuven for his research into the statistical modelling of German word order variation. Since 2006, he is a postdoctoral fellow at the Leuven research unit Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics (QLVL), where he has further pursued his research into statistical language modelling with a focus on lexical patterns and word meaning in Dutch.</p> <h2><a name=\"Geris\"></a><span style=\"font-size: medium;\" rel=\"font-size: medium;\">Dr. ir. Lies Geris. Modeling in biomechanics and biomedical engineering</span></h2> <p><em>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division of Biomechanics and Engineering Design</em></p> <p>The first part of the presentation will discuss the development and applications of a mathematical model of fracture healing.  The model encompasses several key-aspects of the bone regeneration process, such as the formation of blood vessels and the influence of mechanical loading on the progress of healing.  The model is applied to simulate adverse healing conditions leading to a delayed or nonunion.  Several potential therapeutic approaches are tested in silico in order to find the optimal treatment strategy.   Going towards patient specific models will require even more computer power than is the case for the generic examples presented here.<br> The second part of the presentation will give an overview of other modeling work in the field of biomechanics and biomedical engineering, taking place in Leuven and Flanders.  The use of super computer facilities is required to meet the demand for more detailed models and patient specific modeling.</p> <p>Dr. ir.

In 2007 she worked for 4 months as an academic visitor at the Centre of Mathematical Biology of Oxford University.  Her research interests encompass the mathematical modeling of bone regeneration during fracture healing, implant osseointegration and tissue engineering applications.  The phenomena described in the mathematical models reach from the tissue level, over the cell level, down to the molecular level. She works in close collaboration with experimental and clinical researchers from the university hospitals Leuven, focusing on the development of mathematical models of impaired healing situations and the in silico design of novel treatment strategies.  She is the author of 36 refereed journal and proceedings articles, 5 chapters and reviews and 18 peer-reviewed abstracts.

With the increase of computer capacity CFD is looking towards more complex applications – because of increased geometrical complication or multidisciplinary aspects e.g. aeroacoustics, turbulent combustion, biological flows, etc – or more refined models such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS).  In this presentation some demanding application fields of CFD will be highlighted, to illustrate this. <br> Computational MHD has a broad range of applications. We will survey some of the most CPU demanding applications in Flanders in the context of examples of the joint initiatives combining expertise from multiple disciplines, the VSC will hopefully lead to, such as the customised applications built in the COOLFluiD and AMRVAC-CELESTE3D projects.</p> <p><strong>Prof. dr. ir.
