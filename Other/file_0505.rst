Next- generation Supercomputing in Flanders: value creation for your business!
==============================================================================

**Tuesday 27 Januari 2015**

| Technopolis Mechelen

The first industry day was a success, thanks to all the presenters and
participates. We especially would like to thank the minister for his
presence. The success stories of European HPC centres showed how
benificial HPC can be for all kinds of industry. The testimonials of the
Flemish firms who already are using large scale computing could only
stress the importance HPC. We will continue to work on the ideas
generated at this meeting so that VSC can strengthen its service to
industry.
