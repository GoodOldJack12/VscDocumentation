|           | **Launch Flemish Supercomputer Center** |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------+

The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum)
cordially invites you to its official launch on **23 March 2009**.

| 
| **Supercomputing** is a crucial technology for the twenty-first
  century. Fast and efficient compute power is needed for leading
  scientific research, the industrial development and the
  competitiveness of our industry. For this reason the Flemish
  government and the five university associations have decided to set up
  a Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC). This centre will combine the
  clusters at the various Flemish universities in a single
  high-performance network and expand it with a large cluster that can
  withstand international comparison. The VSC will make available a
  high-performance and user-friendly supercomputer infrastructure and
  expertise to users from academic institutions and the industry.
