Tier-1b thin node supercomputer BrENIAC
---------------------------------------

This system is since October 2016 in production use.

Purpose
~~~~~~~

On this cluster you can run highly parallel, large scale computations
that rely critically on efficient communication.

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

-  580 computing nodes

   -  Two 14-core Intel Xeon processors (Broadwell, E5-2680v4)
   -  128 GiB RAM (435 nodes) or 256 GiB (145 nodes)

-  EDR InfiniBand interconnect

   -  High bandwidth (11.75 GB/s per direction, per link)
   -  Slightly improved latency over FDR

-  Storage system

   -  Capacity of 634 TB
   -  Peak bandwidth of 20 GB/s

Software
--------

You will find the standard Linux HPC software stack installed on the
Tier-1 cluster. If required, user support will install additional
(Linux) software you require, but you are responsible for taking care of
the licensing issues (including associated costs).

Access
~~~~~~

You can get access to this infrastructure by applying for a starting
grant, submitting a project proposal that will be evaluated on
scientific and technical merits, or by buying compute time.
