We organize regular trainings on many HPC-related topics. The level
ranges fro introductory to advanced. We also actively promote some
courses organised elsewhere. The courses are open to participants at the
university associations. Many are also open to external users (the
limitations often caused by software licenses of the packages used
during hand-ons). For further info, you can contact the `course
coordinator Geert Jan Bex <\%22/en/about-vsc/contact\%22>`__.
