After the successful first VSC users day in January 2014, the second
users day took place at the University of Antwerp on Monday November 30
2015. The users committee organized the day. The plenary sessions were
given by an external and an internal speaker. Moreover, 4 workshops were
organized:

-  VSC for starters (UAntwerp)
   *Upscaling to HPC. We will present you some best practices, give
   advice when using HPC clusters and show some pros and cons when
   moving from desktop to HPC. Even more experienced researchers may be
   interested.
   *
-  Specialized Tier-2 infrastructure: shared memory (KU Leuven)
   *Shared memory: when distributing data is not/no longer an option. We
   will introduce you to the available shared memory infrastructure by
   means of some use cases.*
-  Big data (UGent)
   *We present Hanythingondemand (hod), a solution for running Hadoop,
   Spark and other services on HPC clusters.*
-  Cloud and grid access (VUB)
   *The availability of grid and cloud resources is not so well known in
   VSC. We will introduce you to the cloud environment, explain how it
   can be useful to you and show how you can gain access.*
