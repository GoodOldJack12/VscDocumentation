autumn around the launch of the second Tier-1 system in Flanders.**

Supercharge your business with supercomputing

| **Admission free, but registration required**

The VSC Industry day is the second in a series of annual events. The
goals are to create awareness about the potential of HPC for industry
and to help firms overcome the hurdles to use supercomputing. We are
proud to present an exciting program with testimonials of some Flemish
firms who already have discovered the opportunities of large scale
computing, success stories from a European HPC centre that successfully
collaborates with industry and a presentation by a HPC vendor who has
been very successful delivering solutions to several industries.

**Preliminary program - Supercharge your business with supercomputing**

**Given that the industry day has been postponed, the program is subject
to change.
