Modern microelectronics has created many new opportunities. Today
powerful supercomputers enable us to collect and process huge amounts of
data. Complex systems can be studied through numerical simulation
without having to build a prototype or set up a scaled experiment
beforehand. All this leads to a quicker and cheaper design of new
products, cost-efficient processes and innovative services. To support
this development in Flanders, the Flemish Government was founded in late
2007. Our accumulated expertise and infrastructure is also available to
the industry for R&D.
