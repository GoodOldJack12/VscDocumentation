Tier-1
------

-  Our `current Tier-1 system is
   BrENIAC <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-tier1-breniac\%22>`__,
   operated by KU Leuven. The system is aimed at large parallel
   computing jobs that require a high-bandwidth low-latency
   interconnect. Compute time is again only available upon approval of a
   project. See the `page on Tier-1 project access and links in that
   page <\%22https://www.vscentrum.be/en/access-and-infrastructure/project-access-tier1\%22>`__.
-  Our `first Tier-1 system is
   muk <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-tier1-muk\%22>`__, was
   operated by UGent but is no longer in production.

Experimental setup
------------------

-  `There is a small GPU and Xeon Phi test
   system <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/k20x-phi-hardware\%22>`__ which
   is can be used by all VSC members on request (though a project
   approval is not required at the moment). `The documentation for this
   system is under
   development <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/k20x-phi-hardware\%22>`__.

Tier-2
------

Four university-level cluster groups are also embedded in the VSC and
partly funded from VSC budgets:

-  `The UAntwerpen clusters (hopper and
   leibniz) <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua\%22>`__
-  `The VUB cluster
   (hydra) <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-vub\%22>`__
-  `The UGent local
   clusters <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ugent\%22>`__
-  `The KU Leuven/UHasselt cluster (ThinKing and
   Cerebro) <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-kul\%22>`__
