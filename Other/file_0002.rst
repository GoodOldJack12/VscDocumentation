The VSC-infrastructure consists of two layers. The central Tier-1
infrastructure is designed to run large parallel jobs. It also contains
a small accelerator testbed to experiment with upcoming technologies.
The Tier-2 layer runs the smaller jobs, is spread over a number of
sites, is closer to users and more strongly embedded in the campus
networks. The Tier-2 clusters are also interconnected and integrated
with each other.
