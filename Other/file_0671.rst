The VSC was launched in late 2007 as a collaboration between the Flemish
Government and five Flemish university associations. Many of the VSC
employees have a strong technical and scientific background. Our team
also collaborates with many research groups at various universities and
helps them and their industrial partners with all aspects of
infrastructure usage.

Besides a competitive infrastructure, the VSC team also offers full
assistance with the introduction of High Performance Computing within
your company.
