The VSC is responsible for the development and management of High
Performance Computer Infrastructure used for research and innovation.
The quality level of the infrastructure is comparable to other
computational infrastructures in comparable European regions. In
addition, the VSC is internationally connected through European projects
such as PRACE\ :sup:`(1)` (traditional supercomputing) and
EGI\ :sup:`(2)` (grid computing). Belgium has been a member of PRACE and
participates in EGI via BEgrid, since October 2012.

The VSC infrastructure consists of two layers in the European
multi-layer model for an integrated HPC infrastructure. Local clusters
(Tier-2) at the Flemish universities are responsible for processing the
mass of smaller computational tasks and provide a solid base for the HPC
ecosystem. A larger central supercomputer (Tier-1) is necessary for more
complicated calculations while simultaneously serving as a bridge to
infrastructures at a European level.

The VSC assists researchers active in academic institutions and also the
industry when using HPC through training programs and targeted advice.
This offers the advantage that academia and industrialists come into
contact with each other.

In addition, the VSC also works on raising awareness of the added value
HPC can offer both in academic research and in industrial applications.
