The VSC Industry day is organised for the first time to create awareness
about the potential of HPC for industry and to help firms overcome the
hurdles to use supercomputing. We are proud to present an exciting
program with success stories of European HPC centres that successfully
collaborate with industry and testimonials of some Flemish firms who
already have discovered the opportunities of large scale computing. The
day ends with a networking hour allowing time for informal discussions.

**Program - Next-generation supercomputing in Flanders: value creation
