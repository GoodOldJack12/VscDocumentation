Site Tutorials
==============

VSC sites carry out regular trainings about Linux and the VSC HPC systems. 
You may always find the updated list of `VSC trainings <https://www.vscentrum.be/vsctraining>`__ 
via the VSC website. It is complementary to the information found in this 
user portal, the latter being the reference manual. Below you can find links 
to those training materials.
