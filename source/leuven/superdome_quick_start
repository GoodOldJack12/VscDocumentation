Superdome Quick Start Guide
===========================

How to connect to Superdome?
----------------------------
Superdome does not have a dedicated login node, so in order to work with the system users must 
connect to the same login node used for Genius (login{1,2,3,4}-tier2.hpc.kuleuven.be).
All users having an active VSC account can connect to the login node with the same credentials using the command:

::

  ssh vscXXXXX@login1-tier2.hpc.kuleuven.be
