Breniac login infrastructure
----------------------------

**Breniac was the VSC's Tier-1 cluster hosted by KU Leuven, and it was decomissioned in December 2022.
This page is obsolete, and we keep it only for the future reference.**

Direct login using SSH is possible to all login infrastructure.

.. note::

   Only users involced in an active Tier-1 project have access to the
   infrastructure.

Two types of login nodes are available:

- a classic login node, i.e., SSH access.

  - ``login1-tier1.hpc.kuleuven.be``
  - ``login2-tier1.hpc.kuleuven.be``

- a login node that provides a desktop environment that can be used for,
  e.g., visualization. 
  The NX login node will start a session on a login node that has a GPU, i.e.,
  ``login2-tier1.hpc.kuleuven.be``.
