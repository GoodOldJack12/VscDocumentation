Tier-1 Data Service
===================

Tier-1 Data service is a composition of the philosophy of how to manage the research data and its implementation by the researcher/stakeholders across the universities of Vlaanderen.  Accordingly it also provides the required tools and infrastructure as well as human resources.

Importance of Tier-1 Data Service
---------------------------------

More and more users have computational work that makes intensive use of large data sets. Migrating this data to and from the compute infrastructure whenever it is to be used for a calculation is very inefficient because of the scale. It is therefore necessary to add a data component where large data sets can be stored for a longer period of time and from there also be processed efficiently.

This service has as primary goal to offer the users a platform to easy manage research data and help them to apply the **FAIR** principles to their research data from the very beginning of their projects. This should make it easier to transfer their research data at the end of the project to institutional or domain specific repositories for publication and preservation and when applicable ensure they are made publicly available (open access).

The Tier-1 Data component would provide a service to allow users to store research data during the active phase of the research data life cycle (that is, data that is being collected and analyzed and has not yet being published). This service for now is restricted to data of research projects that are using the VSC Tier-1 Compute infrastructure.

This platform should also help the researchers to run their scientific workflows more efficiently by providing tools to automate data collection, data quality control and stage in a and stage out data from and to Tier-1 Compute system. 

This Tier-1 Data service is based on the Open Source software iRODS (`www.irods.org`_).
