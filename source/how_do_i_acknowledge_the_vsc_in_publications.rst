How do I acknowledge the VSC in publications?
=============================================

When using the VSC-infrastructure for your research, you must
acknowledge the VSC in all relevant publications. This will help the VSC
secure funding, and hence you will benefit from it in the long run as
well. It is also a contractual obligation for the VSC.
