Generating keys on Windows
==========================

To get access from a Windows computer, we currently provide documentation for two SSH clients,
:ref:`PuTTY <text mode access using PuTTY>` and :ref:`MobaXterm <access using mobaxterm>`,
both of which require a public/private key pair in a different format:

* :ref:`generate a key pair with PuTTY <generating keys putty>`
* :ref:`generate a key pair with MobaXterm (OpenSSH format) <generating keys mobaxterm>`
