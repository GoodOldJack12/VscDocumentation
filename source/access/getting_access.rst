Getting access
==============

The VSC account
---------------

In order to use the infrastructure of the VSC, you need a VSC-userid,
also called a VSC account. The account gives you access to most of the
infrastructure, though only with a limited compute time allocation on
some of the systems. Also, For the main Tier-1 compute cluster you need
to submit a project application (or you should be covered by a project
application within your research group). For some more specialised
hardware you have to ask access separately, typically to the coordinator
of your institution, because we want to be sure that that (usually
rather expensive) hardware is used efficiently for the type of
applications it was purchased for.

Who can get a VSC account?
--------------------------

Researchers at the Flemish university associations
   In many cases, this is done through a fully automated application process,
   but in some cases you must submit a request to your local support
   team. Specific details about these procedures can be found on the
   ":ref:`account request`" page in the user documentation.
Master students in the framework of their master thesis
   If supercomputing is needed for the thesis. For this, you will first
   need the approval of your supervisor. The details about the procedure
   can again be found on the ":ref:`account request`" page in the user
   documentation.
Use in courses at the University of Leuven and Hasselt University
   Lecturers can also use the local Tier-2 infrastructure in the
   context of some courses (when the software cannot run in the PC
   classes or the computers in those classes are not powerful enough).
   Again, you can find all the details about the application process on
   the ":ref:`account request`" page in the user
   documentation. It is important that the application is submitted on
   time, at least two weeks before the start of the computer sessions.
Researchers from iMinds and VIB
   The application is made through
   your host university. The same applies to researchers at the
   university hospitals and research institutes under the direction or
   supervision of a university or a university college, such as the
   special university institutes mentioned in Article 169quater of the
   Decree of 12 June 1991 concerning universities in the Flemish
   Community.
Researchers at other Flemish public research institutions
   You can get compute on the Tier-1 infrastructure through a project
   application or access the Tier-2 infrastructure through contact with
   one of the coordinators.
Businesses, non-Flemish public knowledge institutions and not-for-profit organisations
   These entities can buy compute time on the
   infrastructure. The procedures are explained on the page
   ":ref`buying compute time`".

Additional information
----------------------

Before you apply for VSC account, it is useful to first check whether
the infrastructure is suitable for your application. Windows or OS X
programs for instance cannot run on our infrastructure as we use the
Linux operating system on the clusters. The infrastructure also should
not be used to run applications for which the compute power of a good
laptop is sufficient. The pages on the :ref:`tier1 hardware` and
:ref:`tier2 hardware`
in this part of the website give a high-level description of our
infrastructure. You can find more detailed information in the user
documentation on the user portal. When in doubt, you can also contact
your local support team. This does not require a VSC account.

You should also first check the page ":ref:`account request`"
and install the necessary software on your PC. You can also find links
to information about that software on the “Account Request” page.

Furthermore, it can also be useful to take one of the introductory
courses that we organise periodically at all universities. However, it
is best to apply for your VSC account before the course since you also
can then also do the exercises during the course. We strongly urge
people who are not familiar with the use of a Linux supercomputer to
take such a course. After all, we do not have enough staff to help
everyone individually for all those generic issues.

There is an exception to the rule that you need a VSC account to access
the VSC systems: Users with a valid VUB account can access the Tier-2
systems at the VUB.

Your account also includes two “blocks” of disk space: your home
directory and data directory. Both are accessible from all VSC clusters.
When you log in to a particular cluster, you will also be assigned one
or more blocks of temporary disk space, called scratch directories.
Which directory should be used for which type of data, is explained in
the page ":ref:`data location`".

Your VSC account does not give you access to all available software. You
can use all free software and a number of compilers and other
development tools. For most commercial software, you must first prove
that you have a valid license or the person who has paid the license on
the cluster must allow you to use the license. For this you can contact
your local support team.


Tier-1 applications
-------------------

To prepare for a Tier-1 application, you can use ":ref:`Tier-1 application glossary`" of terms
that are used in the application form, and check a :ref:`list of
scientific domains`.
