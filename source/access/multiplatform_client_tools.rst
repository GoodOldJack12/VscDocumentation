Multiplatform client tools
==========================

-  Eclipse is a popular multi-platform Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE) very well suited for code development on clusters.

   -  Read our :ref:`Eclipse introduction <Eclipse intro>` to
      find out why you should consider using Eclipse if you develop code
      and how to get it.
   -  You can use :ref:`Eclipse on the desktop as a remote editor for the
      cluster <Eclipse as remote editor>`.
   -  You can use :ref:`Eclipse on the desktop to access files in a
      subversion repository on the cluster <Eclipse VSC subversion>`.
   -  You can combine the remote editor feature with version control
      from Eclipse, but some care is needed, and :ref:`here's how to do
      it <Eclipse PTP>`.

-  :ref:`Subversion repositories on the VSC-servers (and other servers of
   course) can be accessed from the desktop. <desktop access VSC SVN>`

   Window System connections. NX software is currently available for
   Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.

   -  You can use freeware :ref:`NoMachine NX Client <NX start guide>` to
      connect to HPC cluster in the GUI mode.

-  TurboVNC provides access to remote visualization applications. The
   software is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
