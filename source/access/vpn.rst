VPN
===

To access certain cluster login nodes from outside your institute's network
(e.g., from home) you need to set a so-called VPN (Virtual Private Network).
By setting up a VPN to your institute, your computer effectively becomes a
computer on your institute's network and will appear as such to other services
that you access. Your network traffic will be routed through your institute's
network. If you want more information: There's an
`introductory page on HowStuffWorks <https://computer.howstuffworks.com/vpn.htm>`__
and a `page that is more for techies on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network>`__.

The VPN service is not provided by the VSC but by your institute's ICT centre,
and they are your first contact for help. However, for your convenience, we
present some pointers to that information:

  - VUB: The VUB offers no central VPN system at this time. There is a VPN
    solution, `Pulse Secure VPN <http://vubnet.vub.ac.be/vpn.html>`__, which
    requires special permission.
  - UHasselt: the pre-configured VPN software can be `downloaded <https://software.uhasselt.be/index.php?catid=410>`__
    (intranet, only staff members), contact the
    `UHasselt help desk <mailto:helpdesk@uhasselt.be>`__ (mail link) if you
    have problems. There is also some information about this on the page
    `"Accessibility from distance" <https://bibliotheek.uhasselt.be/en/accessibility-distance>`__
    of the University library.
