MATLAB parallel computing
=========================

Matlab has several products to facilitate parallel computing, e.g.

-  The `Parallel Computing
   Toolbox <https://nl.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html>`_
   is a regular Matlab toolbox that lets you write parallel Matlab
   applications or use parallel implementations of algorithms in other
   toolboxes.
   Try ``help distcomp`` to see if the toolbox is installed for the
   version of Matlab that you're using.
