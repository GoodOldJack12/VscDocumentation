How can I run containers on the HPC systems?
============================================

The best-known container implementation is doubtlessly `docker`_.  However,
due to security concerns HPC sites typically don't allow users to run
Docker containers.

Fortunately, `Singularity`_ addresses container related security issues,
so Singularity images can be used on the cluster.
