What is Globus
--------------

The Globus platform enables developers to provide robust file transfer, sharing and search capabilities within their own research data applications and services, while leveraging advanced identity management, single sign-on, and authorization capabilities.

This document is a hands-on guide to the Globus file sharing platform. It should complement the official documentation at `docs.globus.org`_.

For all questions concerning the Globus file sharing platform, please contact the VSC Globus team at data@vscentrum.be.

We welcome your feedback, comments and suggestions for improving the Globus Tutorial.
