   Globus Collection
       A Globus Collection is a named location containing data you can access with Globus. Collections can be hosted on many different kinds of systems, including campus storage, HPC clusters, laptops, Amazon S3 buckets, Google Drive, and scientific instruments. When you use Globus, you don't need to know a physical location or details about storage. You only need a collection name. A collection allows authorized Globus users to browse and transfer files. Globus Collections can also be used for sharing data with others, for data publication, and for enabling discovery by other Globus users.


   Globus Connect
       Globus Connect is used to host collections.

   Endpoint
       An endpoint is a server that hosts Globus Collections. If you want to be able to access, share, transfer, or manage data using Globus, the first step is to create an endpoint on the system where the data is (or will be) stored. An endpoint can be a laptop, a personal desktop system, a laboratory server, a campus data storage service, a cloud service, or an HPC cluster.
