Local endpoints
---------------

Users can create and manage endpoints on their personal computers via `Globus Connect Personal`_. Globus Connect Personal is available for all major operating systems. Download the software and follow the installation instructions. During the setup process you will be asked to set the local endpoint. Each endpoint has a unique ID. Those ones created or managed by you are associated with your Globus account.

To access and manage your local endpoints:

- Start the **Globus Connect Personal** applet.

- From a browser log into Globus and in the File Manager navigate to :bgrnd1:`Endpoints`. Then select the :bgrnd1:`Administered by you` tab.

- To change the attributes of an endpoint click on its name. You can adjust a variety of settings like private or public, endpoint name, contact info, and encryption.
