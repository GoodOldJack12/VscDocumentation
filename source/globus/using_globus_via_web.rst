Globus web interface
===============

This section teaches you how to manage, transfer and share files from the `Globus web interface <https://app.globus.org/>`_.



Managing files
-------------

Once you log in to Globus, you will immediately be transported to the **File Manager**, where you can browse and manage your files in your collections.

The first time you log in, no collection will be selected. To select a collection, click in the **Collection** text field at the top, and it allows you to search for a collection.
The first time you open a certain collection (e.g. 'VSC KU Leuven tier2 Scratch'), you might need to authenticate:

In some collections, you might arrive immediately at your personal files. In other collections, you still need to go to your own folders.
You can move to other folders in two ways:

- Type the path you want to go to in the 'Path' textbox and press 'enter'.
- Click on the name/icon of a folder to move into it.

If you ever want to go back to the previous level, you can click on the button 'up one folder'. 


Uploading/downloading files via HTTPS
------------------

The Globus web interface allows you to upload and download data from your local pc to a collection over HTTPS.

To upload a collection, click on the 'Upload' icon:

Globus might ask you for consent to move files over HTTPS. After being moved back to the file manager, click on the 'Upload' icon again.  
You will be presented with a choice between 'Select Files to Upload' and 'Select Folder to Upload'. Once you click one of these buttons, a wizard will open to help you select the files/folder to upload.

To download a file or folder over HTTPS, hover over its name. You should see a checkbox appearing next to the name: click it.  

In the menu on the right, you should see the icon 'Download' lighting up






Transferring files between collections
