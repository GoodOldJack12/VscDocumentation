Multiplatform client tools
==========================

-  Eclipse is a popular multi-platform Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE) very well suited for code development on clusters.

   -  Read our `Eclipse
      introduction <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-intro\%22>`__ to
      find out why you should consider using Eclipse if you develop code
      and how to get it.
   -  You can use `Eclipse on the desktop as a remote editor for the
      cluster <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-remote-editor\%22>`__.
   -  You can use `Eclipse on the desktop to access files in a
      subversion repository on the
      cluster <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-vsc-subversion\%22>`__.
   -  You can combine the remote editor feature with version control
      from Eclipse, but some care is needed, and `here's how to do
      it <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-ptp-versioncontrol\%22>`__.

-  `Subversion repositories on the VSC-servers (and other servers of
   course) can be accessed from the
   desktop. <\%22/client/multiplatform/desktop-access-vsc-subversion\%22>`__
-  NX client technology is a computer program that handles remote X
   Window System connections. NX software is currently available for
   Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.

   -  You can use freeware `NoMachine NX
      Client <\%22/client/multiplatform/nx-start-guide\%22>`__ to
      connect to HPC cluster in the GUI mode.

-  TurboVNC provides access to remote visualization applications. The
   software is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

   -  You can use freeware `TurboVNC
      Client <\%22/client/multiplatform/turbovnc\%22>`__ to connect to
      the visualization nodes of HPC cluster.
