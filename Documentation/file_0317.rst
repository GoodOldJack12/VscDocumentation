Prerequisite: PuTTY and WinSCP
------------------------------

You've `generated a public/private key pair with
PuTTY <\%22/client/windows/keys-putty\%22>`__ and have an approved
account on the VSC clusters.

Connecting to the VSC clusters
------------------------------

When you start the PuTTY executable 'putty.exe', a configuration screen
pops up. Follow the steps below to setup the connection to (one of) the
VSC clusters.

In the screenshots, we show the setup for user vsc98765 to the ThinKing
cluster at K.U.Leuven via the loginnode login.hpc.kuleuven.be.

You can find the names and ip-addresses of the loginnodes in the
sections of `the local VSC
clusters <\%22/infrastructure/hardware\%22>`__.

| Alternatively, you can follow a `short
  video <\%22https://www.vscentrum.be/assets/1191\%22>`__ explaining
  step-by-step the process of making connection to VSC login nodes
  (example based on KU Leuven cluster).

#. Within the category Session, in the field 'Host Name', type in
   <vsc-loginnode>, which is the name of the loginnode of the VSC
   cluster you want to connect to.
   |\\"PuTTY|
#. In the category Connection > Data, in the field 'Auto-login
   username', put in <vsc-account>, which is your VSC username that you
   have received by mail after your request was approved.
#. In the category Connection > SSH > Auth, click on 'Browse' and select
   the private key that you generated and saved above.
   |\\"PuTTY|
   Here, the private key was previously saved in the folder
   C:\\Documents and Settings\\Me\\Keys. In newer versions of Windows,
   \\"C:\\Users\" is used instead \\"C:\\Documents and Settings\".
#. In the category Connection > SSH > X11, click the Enable X11
   Forwarding checkbox:
   |\\"PuTTY|
#. Now go back to Session, and fill in a name in the 'Saved Sessions'
   field and press 'Save' to store the session information.
#. Now pressing 'Open' should start ask for you passphrase, and connect
   you to <vsc-loginnode>.

The first time you make a connection to the loginnode, a Security Alert
will appear and you will be asked to verify the authenticity of the
loginnode.

For future sessions, just select your saved session from the list and
press 'Open'.
