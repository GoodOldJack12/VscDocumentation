Software development
====================

Programming paradigms and models
--------------------------------

-  `MPI <\%22/cluster-doc/development/mpi\%22>`__ for message passing
   distributed memory programming
-  `OpenMP <\%22/cluster-doc/development/openmp\%22>`__ shared memory
   programming
-  `Hybrid
   MPI/OpenMP <\%22/cluster-doc/development/hybrid-mpi-openmp\%22>`__
   programs

Development tools
-----------------

-  `Toolchains <\%22/cluster-doc/development/toolchains\%22>`__ are a
   collection of tools to build software. Not available on some of the
   older clusters.

   -  `Intel
      toolchain <\%22/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-intel\%22>`__
      (mostly Intel compilers and libraries)
   -  `FOSS
      toolchain <\%22/cluster-doc/development/toolchain-foss\%22>`__
      (open source components)

-  `Version control
   systems <\%22/cluster-doc/development/version-control\%22>`__

   -  `An overview <\%22/cluster-doc/development/version-control\%22>`__
   -  `Subversion <\%22/cluster-doc/development/subversion\%22>`__ for
      version control
   -  `Git <\%22/cluster-doc/development/versioncontrol-git\%22>`__ for
      version control

-  `Intel Trace Analyzer & Collector
   (ITAC) <\%22/cluster-doc/development/itac\%22>`__ for performance
   analysis of MPI programs
-  `ParameterWeaver <\%22/cluster-doc/development/parameterweaver\%22>`__,
   a code generator for handling command line arguments with C/C++,
   Fortran, R and Octave as target languages

Libraries
---------

-  Mathematics

   -  `BLAS and Lapack dense linear algebra
      libraries <\%22/cluster-doc/development/blas-lapack\%22>`__
      (solving linear systems, eigenvalues, singular values)

-  Perl

   -  `How to install additional Perl
      packages? <\%22/cluster-doc/development/perl-packages\%22>`__

-  Python

   -  `How to install additional Python
      packages? <\%22/cluster-doc/development/python-packages\%22>`__

Integrating code with software packages
---------------------------------------

-  `Integrating C code into
   R <\%22/cluster-doc/software/r-integrate-c-functions\%22>`__
