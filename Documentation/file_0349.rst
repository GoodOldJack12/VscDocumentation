Since all VSC clusters use Linux as their main operating system, you
will need to get acquainted with using the command-line interface and
using the Terminal. To open a Terminal window in macOS (formerly OS X),
choose Applications > Utilities > Terminal in the Finder.

If you don't have any experience with using the Terminal, we suggest you
to read the `basic Linux
usage <\%22/cluster-doc/using-linux/basic-linux-usage\%22>`__ section
first (which also applies to macOS).

Getting ready to request an account
-----------------------------------

-  Before requesting an account, you need to generate a pair of ssh
   keys. One popular way to do this on macOS is\ `using the OpenSSH
   client <\%22/client/macosx/keys-openssh\%22>`__ included with macOS
   which you can then also use to log on to the clusters.

Connecting to the machine
-------------------------

-  Open a text-mode session using an SSH client: `OpenSSH ssh command or
   JellyfiSSH <\%22/client/macosx/login-openssh\%22>`__.
-  Transfer data using Secure FTP (SFTP) with the `OpenSSH sftp and scp
   commands, Cyberduck or
   FileZilla <\%22/client/macosx/data-cyberduck\%22>`__.
-  Running GUI programs or other programs that use graphics.

   -  Linux programs use the X protocol to display graphics on local or
      remote screens. To use your Mac as a remote screen, you need to
      install a X server. `XQuartz <\%22https://www.xquartz.org/\%22>`__
      is one that is freely available. Once the X server is up and
      running, you can simply open a terminal window and connect to the
      cluster using the command line SSH client in the same way as you
      would on Linux.
   -  On the KU Leuven/UHasselt clusters it is possible to `use the NX
      Client <\%22/client/multiplatform/nx-start-guide\%22>`__ to log on
      to the machine and run graphical programs. Instead of an X-server,
      another piece of client software is needed. That software is
      currently available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.
   -  The KU Leuven/UHasselt and UAntwerp clusters also offer support
      for visualization software through TurboVNC. VNC renders images on
      the cluster and transfers the resulting images to your client
      device. VNC clients are available for Windows, macOS, Linux,
      Android and iOS.

      -  On the KU Leuven/UHasselt clusters, `TurboVNC is supported on
         the visualization
         nodes <\%22/client/multiplatform/turbovnc\%22>`__.
      -  On the UAntwerp clusters, TurboVNC is supported on all regular
         login nodes (without OpenGL support) and on the visualization
         node of Leibniz (with OpenGL support through VirtualGL). See
         the page \\"\ `Remote visualization @
         UAntwerp <\%22/infrastructure/hardware/hardware-ua/visualization\%22>`__\\"
         for instructions.

Advanced topics
---------------

-  Eclipse is a popular multi-platform Integrated Development
   Environment (IDE) very well suited for code development on clusters.

   -  Read our `Eclipse
      introduction <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-intro\%22>`__ to
      find out why you should consider using Eclipse if you develop code
      and how to get it. To get the full functionality of the Parallel
      Tools Platform and Fortran support on macOS, you need `to install
      some additional software and start Eclipse in a special way as we
      explain here <\%22/client/macosx/eclipse-on-osx\%22>`__.
   -  You can use `Eclipse on the desktop as a remote editor for the
      cluster <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-remote-editor\%22>`__.
   -  You can use `Eclipse on the desktop to access files in a
      subversion repository on the
      cluster <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-vsc-subversion\%22>`__.
   -  You can combine the remote editor feature with version control
      from Eclipse, but some care is needed, and `here's how to do
      it <\%22/client/multiplatform/eclipse-ptp-versioncontrol\%22>`__.

-  Most popular version control systems, including Subversion and git,
   are supported on macOS. See `our introduction to version control
   systems <\%22https://www.vscentrum.be/cluster-doc/development/version-control\%22>`__.

   -  Specific instructions to `access subversion repositories on the
      VSC clusters or other servers from your desktop with UNIX-style
      command line
      tools <\%22/client/multiplatform/desktop-access-vsc-subversion\%22>`__.
