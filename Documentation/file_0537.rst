How do I acknowledge the VSC in publications?
=============================================

When using the VSC-infrastructure for your research, you must
acknowledge the VSC in all relevant publications. This will help the VSC
secure funding, and hence you will benefit from it in the long run as
well. It is also a contractual obligation for the VSC.

Please use the following phrase to do so in Dutch “De
rekeninfrastructuur en dienstverlening gebruikt in dit werk, werd
voorzien door het VSC (Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum), gefinancierd door
het FWO en de Vlaamse regering – departement EWI”, or in English: “The
computational resources and services used in this work were provided by
the VSC (Flemish Supercomputer Center), funded by the Research
Foundation - Flanders (FWO) and the Flemish Government – department
EWI”.

Moreover, if you are in the KU Leuven association, you are also
requested to add the relevant papers to the virtual collection \\"High
Performance Computing\" in Lirias so that we can easily generate the
publication lists with relevant publications.
