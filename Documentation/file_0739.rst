Basic job system use
--------------------

-  `Job system
   basics <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/job-system-basics\%22>`__
-  `Credit system
   basics <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/credit-system-basics\%22>`__
   (KU Leuven-only currently)
-  `Why doesn't my job start
   immediately? <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/job-start-failure\%22>`__
   A story about scheduling policies and priorities.
-  `Job failure after a successful
   start <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/job-failure-after-start\%22>`__

Advanced job system use
-----------------------

-  `Advanced PBS/Torque
   options <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/advanced-torque\%22>`__
-  `Moab commands <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/moab-commands\%22>`__
-  `Worker
   framework <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/worker-framework\%22>`__: To
   manage lots of small jobs on a cluster. The cluster scheduler isn't
   meant to deal with tons of small jobs. Those create a lot of
   overhead, so it is better to bundle those jobs in larger sets.

Miscellaneous topics
--------------------

-  `Monitoring memory and CPU usage of
   programs <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/monitoring-memory-and-cpu-usage-of-programs\%22>`__,
   which helps to find the right parameters to use in the job scripts.
-  The `checkpointing
   framework <\%22/cluster-doc/running-jobs/checkpointing-framework\%22>`__
   can be used to run programs that take longer than the maximum time
   allowed by the queue. It can break a long job in shorter jobs, saving
   the state at the end to automatically start the next job from the
   point where the previous job was interrupted.
